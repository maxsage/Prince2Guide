                    <p>A project is required to organize and run a conference for between 80 and 100 delegates. The date and
                        subject matter are set, and the focus of the conference is to bring members of a particular profession up to
                        date on recent developments in professional procedures and standards. The project team will need to identify
                        a venue, and check its availability, facilities and price before booking it. They will also need to identify
                        suitable speakers and book them, before producing a detailed agenda and programme. A mailing list of
                        delegates is available, and once the venue has been booked, the project team will need to issue a press
                        release based on the agreed programme. Part of the project will involve producing 100 delegate handouts,
                        with a cover reflecting the selected subject matter. These handouts must contain a printed agenda covering
                        the agreed programme, copies of slides and notes used by the speakers, and a feedback form to capture
                        attendee reviews. Booking arrangements for attending the conference, including details of the programme and
                        venue, must be sent out in the mail-shot. The team will need to regularly update the attendance list based on
                        responses to the mail-shot, and make arrangements to recruit staff to help on the day, based on the final
                        attendance list.</p>

                        structure to the product flow diagram. For example, in this scenario the planner has used ‘publicity’ in the
                        product breakdown structure but the only publicity products that need to be produced are the mail-shot and
                        press release. ‘Publicity’ is not a product that requires work but a convenient way to describe the products
                        that provide the publicity for the conference, whereas the delegate handout is a product that is created by
