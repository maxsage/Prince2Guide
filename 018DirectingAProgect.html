                <h2>18.1 PRINCE2 GUIDANCE ON DIRECTING A PROJECT</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the Directing a Project process is to enable the project board to be accountable for
                    the project’s success by making key decisions and exercising overall control while delegating
                    day-to-day management of the project to the project manager.</p>
                <p>The objective of the Directing a Project process is to ensure that:</p>
                <p>There is authority to initiate the project</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is authority to deliver the project’s products</li>
                    <li>Management direction and control are provided throughout the project’s life, and that the
                        project remains viable
                    </li>
                    <li>Corporate or programme management has an interface to the project</li>
                    <li>There is authority to close the project</li>
                    <li>Plans for realizing the post-project benefits are managed and reviewed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Directing a Project process starts on completion of the Starting up a Project process and is
                    triggered by the request to initiate a project.</p>
                <p>The Directing a Project process does not cover the day-to-day activities of the project manager, but
                    the activities of those at the level of management above the project manager: that is, the project
                    board. The project board manages by exception. It monitors via reports and controls through a small
                    number of decision points. There should be no need for other ‘progress meetings’ for the project
                    board. The project manager will inform the board of any exception situation. It is also important
                    that levels of authority and decision-making processes are clearly identified.</p>

                    <img src="images/Figure18-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;"/>

                </figure>
                <p>There needs to be a two-way flow of information between the project board and corporate or programme
                    management during the project. It is a key role of the project board to engage with corporate or
                    programme management and to act as a communication channel. This need, and how it is to be
                    satisfied, should be documented in the communication management strategy.</p>
                <p>The project board should provide unified direction and guidance to the project manager. If the
                    project board is unable to provide a single view or if independent, possibly contradictory, advice
                    is given, then the risk of project failure significantly increases. In such cases, the project
                    manager should defer to the executive.</p>
                <p>The project board is responsible for assuring that there is continued business justification. The
                    Directing a Project process provides a mechanism for the project board to achieve such assurance
                    without being overburdened by project activity.</p>
                <p>One of the functions of the project board is to provide informal advice and guidance to the project
                    manager as well as formal direction. The project manager should seek advice whenever necessary
                    during the course of the project.</p>
                <h2>18.2 AGILE WAYS OF WORKING THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST</h2>
                <p>Agile usually sees steering and direction as the role of a product owner, although this depends on
                    the number of teams involved and whether or not there is an ‘overall’ product owner. Alternatively
                    this role could be carried out by the role of sponsor.</p>
                <h2>18.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE ON DIRECTING A PROJECT</h2>
                <p>Although it is essential to use this process it is vital to ensure that management by exception is
                    operating effectively for the whole project management team as this creates an environment conducive
                    to the agile way of working where people are empowered and self-organize.</p>
                <p>In terms of progress reporting the project board should expect there to be more emphasis placed on
                    the amount being delivered, and the information flows may be regular, rich and informal. The project
                    board may even attend reviews.</p>
                <p>Decision-making could be further enhanced by attending key demos.</p>
                <p>Decision-making may be based more on information pulled from the project as opposed to formally
                    reported.</p>
                <p>Some, or most, of the benefits are likely to be enabled or delivered during the project. Corporate
                    and programme management should understand the rationale behind agile and how it delivers products
                    and benefits.</p>
                <h3>18.3.1 How to …</h3>
                <p>There are many behaviours, concepts, frameworks and techniques that are used in agile and referenced
                    throughout this manual. Table 18.1 provides cross-references to some of the most relevant for use
                    during Directing a Project.</p>

                <h2>18.4 SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>In PRINCE2 the project board is ultimately accountable for the ongoing viability of a project. It
                    needs to provide direction and authorization as required.</p>
                <p>In an agile context this needs to happen quickly and should take the form of empowering the project
                    manager and the delivery teams so that information can be pulled; the use of transparency and
                    collaborative interaction helps to ensure that the project remains viable and on target, and that
                    any deviations to this can be detected quickly and responded to immediately.</p>
