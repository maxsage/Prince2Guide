                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>PRINCE2 Agile has been created by a large team of contributors who all share a passion for
                        project management in an agile context. Just for fun, the whole team were asked the following
                        question:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote-footer mb-0 font-italic">What would you say to a relatively inexperienced project manager running a project in an agile
                        context? What advice would you give them?</blockquote>
                    <p>They were asked to express this as a user story in the form:</p>
                    <p>As &lt;a project manager responsible for managing a project using agile&gt;</p>
                    <p>I would &lt;something you would do&gt; </p>
                    <p>So that
                        &lt;some kind of benefit&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>Their replies were as follows; we hope you find them useful.</p>
