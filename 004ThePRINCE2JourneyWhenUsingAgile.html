                <h1>The PRINCE2 journey when using agile</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>This chapter acts as a brief summary of how PRINCE2 would typically look when working in an agile
                    way. The best way to tailor PRINCE2 depends on the project context, and the purpose of this chapter
                    is to illustrate examples that would be common in many situations; however, many other alternatives
                    exist. The chapter illustrates a way but not the way.</p>
                <p>PRINCE2 provides a process model for managing a project (see Figure 4.1). The processes can easily be
                    scaled and tailored to suit the requirements of all types of project. They consist of a set of
                    activities that are required to direct, manage and deliver a project.</p>
                <h2>4.1 PRE-PROJECT AND THE INITIATION STAGE</h2>
                <h3>4.1.1 Pre-project</h3>
                <p>In the beginning, someone has an idea or a need. This may result from new business objectives,
                    responding to competitive pressures, changes in legislation, or a recommendation in a report or an
                    audit. The trigger for the project could be almost anything. In PRINCE2, this trigger is called a
                    project mandate. The project mandate is provided by the commissioning organization (corporate or
                    programme management) and can vary in form from a verbal instruction to a well-defined and justified
                    project definition.</p>
                <p>Prior to the activity to scope the project appropriately, it is important to verify that the project
                    is worthwhile and viable. Such activities are covered by the process Starting up a Project, which
                    culminates in the production of a project brief and a stage plan for project initiation. The project
                    board reviews the project brief and decides whether to initiate the project, and states the levels
                    of authority to be delegated to the project manager for the initiation stage.</p>
                <h3>4.1.2 Initiation stage</h3>
                <p>Once there is a decision to go ahead with the project, it needs to be planned in sufficient detail.
                    Funding needs to be obtained and controls should be defined to ensure that the project proceeds in
                    accordance with the wishes of those people paying for the project and those who will make use of
                    what the project delivers. The planning, establishment of the project management strategies and
                    controls, development of a robust business case, and a means of reviewing benefits are covered by
                    the Initiating a Project process. Also, during the initiation stage, the Managing a Stage Boundary
                    process is used to plan the next stage. The initiation stage culminates in the production of the
                    project initiation documentation, which is reviewed by the project board to decide whether to
                    authorize the project. As the contents of the project initiation documentation are likely to change
                    throughout the project, this version of the project initiation documentation is preserved as input
                    for later performance reviews.</p>
                <h3>4.1.3 How pre-project and the initiation stage would typically look when using agile</h3>
                <h4>4.1.3.1 Plan, monitor and control</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Project-level planning focuses on sets of features and intended releases.</li>
                    <li>There is strong engagement from all levels of the project management team in the planning and
                        estimation activities.

                </figure>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stage-level planning is carried out collaboratively with the customer in order to most
                        accurately meet their needs and achieve the most benefit.
                    </li>
                    <li>Plans are timeboxed in some form – this could be in the form of a specific time interval (e.g.
                        two-weekly) or it could be flow-based over a longer period – and these plans would be created at
                        a time (i.e. ‘just in time’) and a level of detail that is appropriate to allow for
                        uncertainties.

                        Definition: Feature<br> A generic term that is widely used to describe something a product does,
                        or the way in which a product does something. A feature can be at any level of detail (e.g. it
                        is waterproof, it makes a tone when switched off) and can be related to a specific requirement,
                        user story or epic. Another similar term is ‘function’.

                </div>
                <h4>4.1.3.2 Behaviour</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>The use of self-organizing teams and people-centric values such as empowerment may be explicitly
                        defined as part of the project approach.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mandating or recommending the use of specific agile approaches such as Scrum and/or Kanban may
                        be explicitly defined as part of the project approach.
                    </li>
                    <li>The project initiation documentation may have been created collaboratively in a workshop in
                        order to disseminate information to the project team quickly and more accurately and with a high
                        level of engagement and ownership.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>4.1.3.3 Process</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information on what constitutes a minimum viable product (MVP) is defined (see section
                        20.4.2.5).
                    </li>
                    <li>The trigger for the project may have come from a product roadmap.</li>
                    <li>There may be an indication of the appropriate use of agile for the project.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>4.1.3.4 Products</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The project product description is likely to have been defined to show which requirements are
                        mandatory and which are not.
                    </li>
                    <li>The project product description purpose is likely to be outcome-based (focusing on the delivery
                        of value) as opposed to the delivery of a specific solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>Product descriptions have initially been captured using user stories (or as epics), although it
                        will be expected that more will be discovered throughout this phase and beyond.
                    </li>
                    <li>The business case is defined in a flexible way to allow for the amount of what is being
                        delivered (and its value) to change to a degree during the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>The benefits review plan focuses on how to deliver value regularly and as early as possible.
                        This will involve describing what products will be delivered when, and what value will be
                        enabled.
                    </li>
                    <li>The project initiation documentation is likely to be a less formal document, as some of the
                        baseline information is visible in the form of an information radiator (see section 15.4.2).
                    </li>
                    <li>The project initiation documentation will be less detailed in certain sections (e.g. product
                        descriptions), since the solution is not necessarily defined at the start. It is a living
                        document that evolves, although it will still need to be baselined.
                    </li>

                <h2>4.2 SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY STAGES</h2>
                <p>The project board delegates day-to-day control to the project manager on a stage-by-stage basis. The
                    project manager needs to assign work to be done, ensure that the outputs of such work (products)
                    meet relevant specifications, and gain suitable approval where appropriate. The project manager also
                    needs to ensure that progress is in line with the approved plan and that the forecasts for the
                    project’s performance targets are within agreed tolerances. The project manager ensures that a set
                    of project records (daily log, lessons log, issue register, risk register, quality register and
                    configuration item records) are maintained to assist with progress control. The project manager
                    informs the project board of progress through regular highlight reports. The activities to control
                    each stage are covered by the Controlling a Stage process.</p>
                <p>In the Managing Product Delivery process, the team manager(s) or team members execute assigned work
                    packages (that will deliver one or more products) and keep the project manager appraised of progress
                    via checkpoint reports.</p>
                <h3>4.2.1 How subsequent delivery stages would typically look when using agile</h3>
                <h4>4.2.1.1 Plan, monitor and control</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work assignment throughout the stage is carried out collaboratively and in conjunction with the
                        customer in order to address the customer’s needs. This is likely to take the form of the
                        delivery teams collectively selecting their own work (and collaboratively creating
                        customer-focused work packages) as part of the agile concept of self-organization. The focus
                        would be to work iteratively and deliver incrementally.
                    </li>
                    <li>High levels of trust and transparency mean that work packages are defined informally even though
                        they represent a vital component when using PRINCE2 with agile.
                    </li>
                    <li>Self-organizing teams are responding rapidly to change, although this will be within
                        well-understood boundaries in order to ensure the accuracy of the products being delivered.
                    </li>
                    <li>Progress is being measured by work completed and is visualized on a burn chart.</li>
                    <li>Progress is supported by the use of reviews and demonstrations (‘demos’) by the project
                        management team and the delivery teams in association with the customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tracking of time and cost still takes place but it is less prominent than the tracking of
                        features and/or work completed. This is because time and cost are more predictable due to
                        working with fixed timescales and stable teams.
                    </li>
                    <li>Scope and quality criteria are the primary focus of any tolerances used.</li>

                <h4>4.2.1.3 Process</h4>
                <p>If an exception arises it is most likely to have occurred due to the amount being delivered being
                    forecast to go outside the agreed tolerance level, as opposed to other aspects being forecast to
                    exceed tolerance, such as time and cost.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Quality tolerances in product descriptions are written in such a way as to allow for change
                        without compromising the product’s purpose (e.g. there are levels of tolerance that can be
                        prioritized).
                    </li>

                        a sticky note on a Kanban board.

                <h2>4.3 FINAL DELIVERY STAGE</h2>
                <p>As a project is a temporary undertaking, during the final stage (once the project manager has gained
                    approval for all of the project’s products) it is time to decommission the project. The project
                    board needs to be satisfied that the recipients of the project’s products are in a position to own
                    and use them on an ongoing basis. Should this be the case, the products can be transitioned into
                    operational use and the project can close. The project documentation should be tidied up and
                    archived, the project should be assessed for performance against its original plan and the resources
                    assigned to the project need to be released. The closure activities include planning post-project
                    benefits reviews to take place for those benefits that can only be assessed after the products have
                    been in use (and therefore after the project has closed). The activities to decommission a project
                    are covered by the Closing a Project process.</p>
                <h3>4.3.1 How the final delivery stage would typically look when using agile</h3>
                <h4>4.3.1.1 Plan, monitor and control</h4>
                <p>When formal checks are made against the project baseline defined in the project initiation
                    documentation, the key aspects that are assessed include the amount that was delivered, what extra
                    was delivered and what was removed. This will have been happening continually throughout the project
                    as the teams work iteratively and respond to feedback.</p>
                <h4>4.3.1.2 Behaviour</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some of the products that the project intended to deliver may not have been created and may have
                        been replaced by others that were not part of the original plan. This will have been
                        communicated throughout the project and will not come as a surprise to the project board when
                        they authorize project closure.
                    </li>
                    <li>The customer is already in ownership of several products that have transitioned into operational
                        use and is now realizing benefits.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tidying up and archiving is a routine task by this point, as it has been taking place regularly
                        throughout the project; its value is known to everyone and it is not seen as simply a
                        bureaucratic task.

                <ul>
                    <li>Closing and decommissioning a project is not a significant event as it is a case of ‘tidying up’
                        and finishing off many activities to do with lessons, archiving and handover which have already
                        been started because by this point several releases have taken place.
                    </li>
                    <li>Project closure involves (or is held as) a retrospective.</li>
                    <li>There is an assessment of how appropriate the use of agile turned out to be to help with
                        guidance on the use of agile for future projects.

                    <li>Outstanding work still exists on backlogs of some kind (e.g. a release backlog), and this is
                        then moved to other backlogs (e.g. an existing BAU backlog), discarded or archived.
