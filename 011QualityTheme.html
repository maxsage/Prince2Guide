                    <h2>11.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE QUALITY THEME</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Quality theme is to define and implement the means by which the project will
                        verify products that are fit for purpose.</p>
                    <p>The Quality theme defines the PRINCE2 approach to ensuring that the project’s products:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meet business expectations</li>
                        <li>Enable the desired benefits to be achieved subsequently.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The ‘product focus’ principle is central to PRINCE2’s approach to quality.</p>
                    <p>The specific treatment for quality in PRINCE2 is the focus on products from the outset, requiring
                        systematic activities to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify all the project’s products (i.e. to the level at which the project intends to exert
                            control)
                        </li>
                        Define them in product descriptions – including the quality criteria by which they will
                        be assessed; the
                        quality methods to be used in designing, developing and accepting them; and the quality responsibilities of
                        those involved
                    </ul>

                    <ul>Implement and track the quality methods employed throughout the project. The PRINCE2 approach to
                        quality can be summarized simply by the quality audit trail depicted in Figure 11.1.
                    </ul>

                    <h2>11.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITY THEME</h2>
                    <p>There is a lot of emphasis put on quality throughout the whole agile movement, and some of the
                        most prominent agile techniques address this area (e.g. the definition of ‘done’ in Scrum and
                        the general use of acceptance criteria). However, perhaps surprisingly, the Agile Manifesto does
                        not contain the word ‘quality’, although it does refer to working software.</p>

                            Tip<br> Acceptance criteria are commonly used in agile to define how to know if a user story has
                            been completed. See the glossary for definitions of ‘acceptance criteria’ and ‘quality criteria’.

                    <p>Certain concepts that have evolved in most agile approaches are very different from traditional
                        views about how to ensure quality. A Waterfall approach would typically see activities such as
                        quality checking and testing take place after a product has been built. Agile takes a much more
                        dynamic view and uses such concepts as integrating the testing and quality checking ‘as you go’,
                        or even doing this before you start (‘test first’). This contrasts greatly with performing this
                        afterwards or at the end.</p>
                    <p>In some agile environments there may not be a lot of emphasis given to quality planning and
                        quality management during the start of a project, whereas there will usually be a lot of focus
                        on quality control during product development. One approach commonly used in agile is to evolve
                        the definition of quality gradually over time. This is achieved by refining and honing the
                        definition of ‘done’ as work progresses. Another approach is to ensure that all of the
                        quality-checking approaches and tests are written and defined before work commences on building
                        the product.</p>

                    <h3>11.3.1 How to use the PRINCE2 product description</h3>
                    <p>Although product descriptions are mandatory in PRINCE2, they are very flexible and can be written
                        in the form of epics or user stories as long as they meet the requirements of the product
                        description outline (as defined in Appendix A). These represent what are commonly referred to as
                        the project’s ‘requirements’ (see Figure 25.1 for an example of decomposition).</p>
                    <p>Product descriptions can be formal or informal, and they can evolve during the project to allow
                        for change as long as it is clear what the baseline is and what level of plan they have been
                        baselined to (e.g. they could be baselined at the stage plan level). The project management team
                        may decide that the higher-level product descriptions need to be more formally defined (e.g.
                        they are to be baselined in a configuration management system) and the lower-level product
                        descriptions can be informal (e.g. captured as user stories on index cards). When using agile
                        with PRINCE2, full advantage should be taken of the flexibility built into the product
                        description outline as shown in Table 11.1.</p>
                    <h3>11.3.2 Creating the project product description</h3>
                    <p>This can be crafted in a similar way to the product description in that the customer’s quality
                        expectations, acceptance criteria and project-level quality tolerances are defined with a level
                        of formality and detail that embraces the agile way of working.</p>
                    <p>Further to this, when using agile the preferred way to define the purpose of the project product
                        description is to use a clearly defined outcome (or outcomes) – see section 9.4.2 for more
                        information on outcomes. This can also help if the contractual side of the project is to be
                        based on a more agile style of working (see Chapter 28).</p>

                                clarity so that it can be quality checked.

                            The concept of writing tests or quality checks before building the product or sub-product

                    <p>The role of the customer should be well defined as the customer is an essential ingredient when
                        working in an agile way. Apart from their continual involvement and commitment, their
                        responsibilities should be understood by all with respect to such things as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer acceptance</li>
                        <li>Customer documentation</li>

                        <li>Attendance at product demos.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is the upfront quality planning that enables PRINCE2 to develop a strategy for how testing and
                        quality checking will be carried out in advance of the work taking place. If several frequent
                        releases are planned, then this enables the resources needed (human or otherwise) to be assessed
                        and costed so that they can be factored in to the business case.</p>
                    <p>Quality control considerations that look at what quality methods to use (e.g. the frequent use of
                        demos and sprint reviews) are a natural evolution from this planning.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately the learnings from many projects contribute to the evolution of the wider quality
                        management system for an organization, and part of this will involve development of the use of
                        agile.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 takes a holistic view of the whole area of quality, which exists throughout a project and
                        operates at all levels.</p>
                    <h3>11.3.4 How to test: test-first, test-driven and test-as-you go concepts</h3>
                    <p>When using PRINCE2 with agile, a decision has to be made early on, as part of the quality
                        management strategy, as to how much of the testing and quality checking can be carried out in
                        the preferred agile manner of ‘test/check first’ or at least ‘test/check as you go’. This is the
                        one area where transferring agile concepts and techniques from the software development domain
                        needs to be handled carefully. Software can be built iteratively and tested frequently using automated testing. The frequency can be as short as days, hours or
                        minutes in terms of these iterative builds. This approach can still be used for a product such as a marketing
                        campaign but it may not be as easy to build it so quickly or through the use of lots of automation.</p>
                    <p>The challenge here when using PRINCE2 and agile together is to apply this concept as much as
                        possible. The more it can be applied then the more agile the project will be. In an agile
                        software context one approach is to use test-driven development (TDD) in the creation of
                        software. Although this is a software-specific approach, the fundamental thinking behind it has
                        led to similar techniques that can be used at a higher level and not necessarily in an IT
                        context. One such example is behaviour-driven development (BDD); see Table 11.2. BDD can be
                        applied to both ‘building the right thing’ and ‘building the thing right’ – sometimes referred
                        to by two separate processes called ‘validation and verification’ (or V&V).</p>
                    <p>The idea of continually writing tests or quality-checking processes before building a product or sub-product
                        may seem counterintuitive to many but this is one of the concepts of the agile way of working, and when this
                        works in partnership with developing the product iteratively and refactoring the product (see Table 11.2), this
                        helps to build the appropriate level of quality into the final product.</p>
                    <p>This can be quite challenging but it is agile best practice and is one of the reasons why the agile way of
                        working has become popular (because it ensures that quality is built into a product).</p>

                                requires automation and usually takes place at the ‘unittesting’ level (i.e. the

                                (e.g. what the customer may want to achieve). It uses a style of language that is easy
                                for the customer to understand (hence the use of words such as ‘behaviour’ in preference
                                to ‘test’).

                                whether or not it contains software.

                                eventual consequences of poor system design, software architecture or the software
                                development itself. The debt can be thought of as work that needs to be done before a
                                particular job can be considered complete. If the debt is not repaid, then it will keep
                                on accumulating interest, making it hard to implement changes later on. Unaddressed
                                technical debt increases the level of disorder in the software and therefore its overall
                                level of quality. In a PRINCE2 context tolerances may be applied to this, and if the
                                debt is forecast to become too significant it will cause an exception

                    <h2>11.5 QUALITY THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>It is important when using agile to distinguish between the quality of a product (defined by
                        quality criteria) and the scope (defined by the products themselves). Some project management
                        philosophies see a reduction in scope as a reduction in quality. PRINCE2 does not see it this
                        way. From the beginning of a project the customer’s quality expectations (and associated
                        acceptance criteria) are set, and this level of quality needs to be maintained. At the end of a
                        project if 10% of the scope is not delivered but the remaining 90% that has been delivered has
                        achieved the desired quality level, then this is seen by PRINCE2 as a reduction in scope, not a
                        reduction in the quality level.</p>
