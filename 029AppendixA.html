                    <h2>A.1 BENEFITS REVIEW PLAN</h2>
                    <h3>A.1.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>A benefits review plan is used to define how and when a measurement of the achievement of the
                        project’s benefits, expected by the senior user, can be made. The plan is presented to the
                        executive during the Initiating a Project process, updated at each stage boundary, and used
                        during the Closing a Project process to define any post-project benefits reviews that are
                        required.</p>
                    <p>The plan has to cover the activities to find out whether the expected benefits of the products
                        have been realized and how the products have performed when in operational use. Each expected
                        benefit has to be assessed for the level of its achievement and whether any additional time is
                        needed to assess the residual benefits. Use of the project’s products may have brought
                        unexpected side-effects, either beneficial or adverse. Time and effort have to be allowed to
                        identify and analyse why these side-effects were not foreseen.</p>
                    <p>If the project is part of a programme, the benefits review plan may be contained within the
                        programme’s benefits realization plan and executed at the programme level. Post-project, the
                        benefits review plan is maintained and executed by corporate or programme management.</p>
                    <h3>A.1.2 Composition</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The scope of the benefits review plan covering what benefits are to be measured</li>

                    <h2>A.2 BUSINESS CASE</h2>
                    <h3>A.2.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>A business case is used to document the justification for the undertaking of a project, based on
                        the estimated costs (of development, implementation and incremental ongoing operations and
                        maintenance costs) against the anticipated benefits to be gained and offset by any associated
                        risks. It should outline how and when the anticipated benefits can be measured.</p>
                    <p>The outline business case is developed in the Starting up a Project process and refined by the
                        Initiating a Project process. The Directing a Project process covers the approval and
                        re-affirmation of the business case. The business case is used by the Controlling a Stage
                        process when assessing impacts of issues and risks. It is reviewed and updated at the end of
                        each management stage by the Managing a Stage Boundary process, and at the end of the project by
                        the Closing a Project process.</p>
                    <h3>A.2.2 Composition</h3>
                    <ul><li><strong>Executive summary</strong> Highlights the key points in the business case, which should include
                        important benefits and the return on investment (ROI)</li>
                        <li>Reasons Defines the reasons for undertaking the project and explains how the project will
                            enable the achievement of corporate strategies and objectives 258 PRINCE2 Agile
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Business options</strong> Analysis and reasoned recommendation for the base business options of: do
                            nothing, do the minimum or do something
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Expected benefits</strong> The benefits that the project will deliver expressed in measurable terms
                            against the situation as it exists prior to the project. Benefits should be both qualitative
                            and quantitative. They should be aligned to corporate or programme benefits. Tolerances
                            should be set for each benefit and for the aggregated benefit. Any benefits realization
                            requirements should be stated
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Expected dis-benefits</strong> Outcomes perceived as negative by one or more stakeholders.
                            Dis-benefits are actual consequences of an activity whereas, by definition, a risk has some
                            uncertainty about whether it will materialize. For example, a decision to merge two elements
                            of an organization onto a new site may have benefits (e.g. better joint working), costs
                            (e.g. expanding one of the two sites) and dis-benefits (e.g. drop in productivity during the
                            merger). Dis-benefits need to be valued and incorporated into the investment appraisal
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Timescale</strong> Over which the project will run (summary of the project plan) and the period over
                            which the benefits will be realized. This information is subsequently used to help timing
                            decisions when planning (project plan, stage plan and benefits review plan)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Costs</strong> A summary of the project costs (taken from the project plan), the ongoing operations
                            and maintenance costs and their funding arrangements
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Investment appraisal</strong> Compares the aggregated benefits and dis-benefits to the project costs
                            (extracted from the project plan) and ongoing incremental operations and maintenance costs.
                            The analysis may use techniques such as cash flow statement, ROI, net present value,
                            internal rate of return and payback period. The objective is to be able to define the value
                            of a project as an investment. The investment appraisal should address how the project will
                            be funded
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Major risks</strong> Gives a summary of the key risks associated with the project together with the
                            likely impact and plans should they occur.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>A.4.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>A communication management strategy contains a description of the means and frequency of
                        communication to parties both internal and external to the project. It facilitates
                        engagement with stakeholders through the establishment of a controlled and bi-directional

                    <p>An issue report is a report containing the description, impact assessment and recommendations for
                        a request for change, off-specification or a problem/concern. It is only created for those

                        been examined and when proposals are identified for issue resolution. The issue report is later
                        amended further in order to record what option was decided upon, and finally updated when the
                        implementation has been verified and the issue is closed.</p>

                    <h2>A.15 LESSONS REPORT</h2>
                    <h3>A.15.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The lessons report is used to pass on any lessons that can be usefully applied to other
                        projects.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the report is to provoke action so that the positive lessons become embedded in
                        the organization’s way of working, and that the organization is able to avoid any negative
                        lessons on future projects.</p>
                    <p>A lessons report can be created at any time in a project and should not necessarily wait until
                        the end. Typically it should be included as part of the end stage report and end project report.
                        It may be appropriate (and necessary) for there to be several lessons reports specific to the
                        particular organization (e.g. user, supplier, corporate or programme).</p>
                    <p>The data in the report should be used by the corporate group that is responsible for the quality
                        management system, in order to refine, change and improve the standards. Statistics on how much
                        effort was needed for products can help improve future estimating.</p>

                    <h3>A.16.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>A plan provides a statement of how and when objectives are to be achieved, by showing the major
                        products, activities and resources required for the scope of the plan. In PRINCE2, there are
                        three levels of plan: project, stage and team. Team plans are optional and may not need to
                        follow the same composition as a project plan or stage plan.</p>
                    <p>An exception plan is created at the same level as the plan that it is replacing. A project plan
                        provides the business case with planned costs, and it identifies the management stages and other
                        major control points. It is used by the project board as a baseline against which to monitor
                        project progress.</p>
                    <p>Stage plans cover the products, resources, activities and controls specific to the stage and are
                        used as a baseline against which to monitor stage progress.</p>
                    <p>Team plans (if used) could comprise just a schedule appended to the work package(s) assigned to
                        the team manager.</p>
                    <p>A plan should cover not just the activities to create products but also the activities to manage
                        product creation – including activities for assurance, quality management, risk management,
                        configuration management, communication and any other project controls required.</p>

                    <h2>A.20 PROJECT INITIATION DOCUMENTATION</h2>
                    <h3>A.20.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of the project initiation documentation is to define the project, in order to form
                        the basis for its management and an assessment of its overall success. The project initiation
                        documentation gives the direction and scope of the project and (along with the stage plan) forms
                        the ‘contract’ between the project manager and the project board.</p>
                    <p>The three primary uses of the project initiation documentation are to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure that the project has a sound basis before asking the project board to make any major
                            commitment to the project
                        </li>
                        <li>Act as a base document against which the project board and project manager can assess
                            progress, issues and ongoing viability questions
                        </li>
                        <li>Provide a single source of reference about the project so that people joining the ‘temporary
                            organization’ can quickly and easily find out what the project is about, and how it is being
                            managed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The project initiation documentation is a living product in that it should always reflect the
                        current status, plans and controls of the project. Its component products will need to be
                        updated and re-baselined, as necessary, at the end of each stage, to reflect the current status
                        of its constituent parts.</p>
                    <p>The version of the project initiation documentation that was used to gain authorization for the
                        project is preserved as the basis against which performance will later be assessed when closing
                        the project.</p>
                    <h3>A.20.2 Composition</h3>
                    <p>There follows a contents list for the project initiation documentation. Note that the first two

                    <h3>A.21.1 Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The project product description is a special form of product description that defines what the
                        project must deliver in order to gain acceptance. It is used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gain agreement from the user on the project’s scope and requirements</li>

                        <li>Define the acceptance criteria, method and responsibilities for the project.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The product description for the project product is created in the Starting up a Project process
                        as part of the initial scoping activity, and is refined during the Initiating a Project process
                        when creating the project plan. It is subject to formal change control and should be checked at
                        stage boundaries (during Managing a Stage Boundary) to see if any changes are required. It is
                        used by the Closing a Project process as part of the verification that the project has delivered
                        what was expected of it, and that the acceptance criteria have been met.</p>

                            derived from a risk breakdown structure or prompt list. If no risks have been recorded
                            against a category, this may suggest that the risk identification has not been as thorough
                            as it should have been
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Risk response categories</strong> Definition of the risk response categories to be used, which
                            themselves depend on whether a risk is a perceived threat or an opportunity

                            of the project so that if certain predefined levels are reached, corrective action will be
                            triggered. They will be selected for their relevance to the project objectives
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Risk tolerance</strong> Defining the threshold levels of risk exposure, which, when exceeded, require
                            the risk to be escalated to the next level of management. (For example, a project-level risk
                            tolerance could be set as any risk that, should it occur, would result in loss of trading.
                            Such risks would need to be escalated to corporate or programme management.) The risk
                            tolerance should define the risk expectations of corporate or programme management and the
                            project board
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Risk budget</strong> Describing whether a risk budget is to be established and, if so, how it will be
