                    <h1>Appendix E The fundamental values and principles of agile
                        (including the Agile Manifesto)</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>There are a wide variety of agile frameworks, methods and approaches, and many of them give significant
                        prominence to a set of fundamental behaviours. These are referred to using such terms as principles and
                        values. They represent a mind-set and are usually core to the way an approach works, and therefore if they
                        are compromised in any way then so is the approach. The values and principles of some of the agile
                        frameworks, methods and approaches are discussed in this appendix. Some of the approaches below are for
                        software development only.</p>
                    <h2>E.1 THE AGILE MANIFESTO (THE MANIFESTO FOR AGILE SOFTWARE
                        DEVELOPMENT)</h2>
                    <p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
                        Through this work we have come to value:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                        <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                        <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                        <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. The
                        manifesto is a set of values (www.agilemanifesto.org). There are 12 principles behind it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of
                            valuable software.
                        </li>
                        <li>We welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change
                            for the customer’s competitive advantage.
                        </li>
                        <li>We deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
                            preference for the shorter timescale.
                        </li>
                        <li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
                        <li>We build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they
                            need, and trust them to get the job done.
                        </li>
                        <li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development
                            team is face-to-face conversation.
                        </li>
                        <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                        <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should
                            be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
                        <li>Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.</li>
                        <li>The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
                        <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and
                            adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>E.2 SCRUM THEORY</h2>
                    <p>Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transparency</li>
                        <li>Inspection</li>
                        <li>Adaptation.</li>

                        <li>Respect.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>E.4 THE FOUR CORE VALUES OF THE SCALED AGILE FRAMEWORK (SAFe) V3.0</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alignment (i.e. lining up work to such things as vision and strategy)</li>
                        <li>Code quality</li>
                        <li>Transparency</li>
                        <li>Programme execution (i.e. getting things done).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>E.5 THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT DECLARATION OF INTERDEPENDENCE</h2>
                    <p>This was published in 2004/2005 by a group of several agile thought leaders. It was an evolution
                        of the Agile Manifesto and its aim was to address a wider audience such as the project
                        management community and not necessarily just those in the software domain (www.pmdoi.org). To
                        achieve successful results, the declaration commits its proponents to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase return on investment by making continuous flow of value their focus</li>
                        <li>Deliver reliable results by engaging customers in frequent interactions and shared
                            ownership
                        </li>
                        <li>Expect uncertainty and manage for it through iterations, anticipation and adaptation</li>
                        <li>Unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing that individuals are the ultimate source of
                            value and creating an environment where they can make a difference
                        </li>
                        <li>Boost performance through group accountability for results and shared responsibility for
                            team effectiveness
                        </li>
                        <li>Improve effectiveness and reliability through situationally specific strategies, processes
                            and practices.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>E.6 THE EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF THE DYNAMIC SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT METHOD</h2>
                    <p>The principles of the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) represent the ethos and culture
                        that need to exist for the successful use of agile. If any of the principles is not being
                        adhered to, this represents a significant risk to the project and therefore the project manager
                        needs to respond accordingly.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus on the business need</li>
                        <li>Deliver on time</li>
                        <li>Collaborate</li>
                        <li>Never compromise quality</li>
                        <li>Build incrementally from firm foundations</li>
                        <li>Develop iteratively</li>

                        <li>Demonstrate control.</li>

                        <li>Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally (using models and the scientific method).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
