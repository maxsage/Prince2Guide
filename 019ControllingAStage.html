                    <h2>19.1 PRINCE2 GUIDANCE ON CONTROLLING A STAGE</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Controlling a Stage process is to assign work to be done, monitor such work,
                        deal with issues, report progress to the project board, and take corrective actions to ensure
                        that the stage remains within tolerance.</p>
                    <p>The objective of the Controlling a Stage process is to ensure that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attention is focused on delivery of the stage’s products. Any movement away from the direction and products agreed at the start of the stage is monitored to avoid uncontrolled change (‘scope creep’) and loss of focus.</li>
                        <li>Risks and issues are kept under control.</li>
                        <li>The business case is kept under review.</li>
                        <li>The agreed products for the stage are delivered to stated quality standards, within cost, effort and time agreed, and ultimately in support of the achievement of the defined benefits.</li>
                        <li>The project management team is focused on delivery within the tolerances laid down.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Controlling a Stage process describes the work of the project manager in handling the
                        day-to-day management of the stage. This process will be used for each delivery stage of a
                        project. Towards the end of each stage, except the final one, the activities within the Managing
                        a Stage Boundary process will occur.</p>
                    <p>The Controlling a Stage process is normally first used after the project board authorizes the
                        project, but it may optionally be used during the initiation stage for large or complex projects
                        with a lengthy initiation.</p>

                        <img src="images/Figure19-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 19-001 Overview of Controlling a Stage</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Work packages are used to define and control the work to be done, and also to set tolerances for
                        the team manager(s). In the case where the project manager is fulfilling the team manager role,
                        work packages should still be used to define and control the work of the individual team members
                        being assigned work. Where this is the case, references to team manager throughout the
                        Controlling a Stage process should be regarded as references to the individual team member being
                        assigned work.</p>
                    <p>Central to the ultimate success of the project is the day-to-day control of the work that is
                        being conducted. Throughout a stage, this will consist of a cycle of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Authorizing work to be done</li>
                        <li>Monitoring progress information about that work, including signing off completed work
                            packages
                        </li>
                        <li>Reviewing the situation (including that for product quality) and triggering new work
                            packages
                        </li>
                        <li>Reporting highlights</li>
                        <li>Watching for, assessing and dealing with issues and risks</li>
                        <li>Taking any necessary corrective action.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Towards the end of the last stage, the Closing a Project process will be invoked</p>
                    <h2>19.2 AGILE WAYS OF WORKING THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST</h2>
                    <p>The nearest equivalent to a stage within agile would be a higher-level timebox that acts as a
                        container for a set of lower-level timeboxes. This may be referred to using terms such as
                        release, iteration or increment. These could involve more than one team and they would be
                        typically managed by a project manager or product manager (the latter being at a higher level
                        than a product owner).</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that a management stage is slightly different from such concepts as a release,
                        iteration or increment in that it focuses on the commitment of resources and grants the project
                        manager the authority to spend within the context of ongoing project viability. This is in
                        contrast to a timebox such as a sprint or a release, which delivers a distinct set of
                        features.</p>
                    <p>A concept known as a ‘Scrum of Scrums’ is sometimes used in agile when there are multiple teams
                        and this provides a mechanism to move information between the teams. It provides an opportunity
                        for Scrum masters to raise project-level issues and discuss inter-team dependencies. This does
                        not conflict with the role of the PRINCE2 project manager as it is not a mechanism for control.
                        It is more focused on ensuring transparency and collaboration across the related teams. However,
                        a Scrum of Scrums meeting would not typically involve the project manager.</p>
                    <p>Scrum of Scrums is not part of the Scrum Guide and therefore the use of this technique and its
                        role should be agreed collectively. Ultimately the project manager is responsible for the
                        successful completion of the stage and should use this technique as appropriate in order to help
                        with areas such as communication and coordination. The project manager has three alternatives
                        with respect to Scrum of Scrums meetings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Doesn’t use them</li>
                        <li>Attends and facilitates the meetings</li>
                        <li>Uses them but may or may not attend the meetings (and uses other sources of information to
                            help with the management of the stage – for example, the use of information radiators and
                            liaising with the delivery teams by other means such as informal discussions).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>19.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE ON CONTROLLING A STAGE</h2>
                    <h3>19.3.1 The structure of a stage</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stages are likely to be made up of timeboxes (e.g. one or more releases, containing one or
                            more sprints), with the focus being on delivering sets of features ideally into operational
                            use and therefore enabling their respective benefits.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>19.3.2 Work assignment</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Planning, scheduling and estimating are likely to be carried out as a collaborative
                            team-based exercise.
                        </li>
                        <li>At the delivery level team members typically select the next piece of work to be done based
                            on the order decided by the customer SME (such as a product owner) who is in the delivery
                            team. As a result, work is typically not assigned to specific team members.
                        </li>
                        <li>Work packages provide the flexibility (e.g. through tolerances) needed to enable teams to
                            self-organize, and their sign-off may be informal. Reviews and demos at the end of a sprint
                            or a release provide rich and regular feedback to the customer as a means to validate that
                            the acceptance criteria for the agreed work package have been met.
                        </li>
                        <li>A work package may contain several timeboxes (e.g. in the form of sprints) and although each
                            one will deliver something, they may not necessarily deliver something into operational use.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>19.3.3 Monitoring progress and reporting</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Within agile environments, teams report progress to one another during the daily stand-up. The project manager or team managers may be invited to attend/assist stand-up meetings if appropriate, and/or facilitate stand-up meetings.</li>
                    <li>Reporting of progress during a sprint within a release to which it belongs is typically done via information radiators.</li>
                    <li>Reporting of progress at the end of a sprint or a release is done via the sprint or release review and the optional product demo, which provides the opportunity to discuss planned features which were not delivered or those that were but were not originally planned for the release.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring and forecasting in general is more likely to be in an empirical style (based on evidence).</li>
                    <li>Progress is more likely to be shown as a burn chart rather than a Gantt chart.</li>
                    <li>Although PRINCE2 identifies six aspects of control the project manager will focus on flexing the scope and the quality criteria of the defined products. The details of these products may be held in the form of backlogs for the project as a whole, the stage, a release inside a stage or a sprint.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>19.3.4 Risks and issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The daily stand-up provides the delivery team with the opportunity to identify issues.
                            Issues may be referred to as blockers, impediments or smells by the delivery team. This
                            approach ensures that issues are uncovered and escalated quickly to ensure that sprint and
                            release goals are not compromised.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sprint and release retrospectives also provide an opportunity for risks and/or issues that
                            may have been missed in the daily stand-ups or review sessions to be highlighted by the
                            team.
                        </li>
                        <li>Risks and issues identified by the agile assessment need to be monitored regularly.</li>
                        <li>During retrospective sessions teams are encouraged to select only those
                        corrective actions that they can
                    reasonably expect to be able to implement in the next sprint or release. This makes it more likely for the
                    corrective action to be successful and to have the greatest positive effect for the team.</li>

                    <h3>19.4.1 Retrospectives</h3>
                    <p>The retrospective is a very common technique and is used regularly when working in an agile way.
                        It involves looking back and reflecting on how things went in terms of how a team worked, in
                        order to make improvements to how they work going forward. A retrospective is a type of review
                        that specifically looks at the way of working as opposed to looking at what was produced (e.g.
                        sprint review).</p>

                    <h4>19.4.1.1 The basics</h4>
                    <p>The role of retrospectives is extremely important. It could be said that this is as significant
                        as any concept, technique or behaviour in agile. It is central to learning lessons and can be
                        part of any continual improvement process. Therefore, not only do retrospectives need to be
                        carried out, but they need to be carried out well.</p>
                    <p>The most important point to understand about retrospectives, and running them well, is that they
                        must be planned, structured and facilitated. If they are run as an unstructured meeting, they
                        can become ineffective and they may also become a chore. How to run a retrospective is decided
                        by the team, so it may become quite informal; however this does not imply any lack of
                        structure.</p>

                            Tip<br>  PRINCE2 uses the term ‘review’ for a specific purpose (i.e. when using the quality review
                            technique) whereas it is used frequently in many forms when using agile.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Not only do retrospectives need to be planned, but they also need to be adapted to keep the
                        participants stimulated. Retrospectives are only as good as the contributions made by the people
                        who take part.</p>
                    <h4>19.4.1.2 Further information</h4>
                    <p>The first step in all PRINCE2 processes is to take the learnings from previous projects or
                        stages. A retrospective can last any length of time but it is usually proportionate to the
                        duration of activity that is being reviewed. A retrospective for a two-week sprint may take two
                        hours, whereas a retrospective of a six-month project may take a whole day. In effect a
                        retrospective is a mini-workshop. Section 26.4.1 describes how powerful workshops can be; all of
                        the tools, techniques and considerations involved in workshops can also be used by
                        retrospectives. Examples would be the choice of tool or technique, how to manage conflict,
                        laying out the room etc.</p>
                    <p>A lot of guidance exists on how to run a retrospective and it closely aligns with how to run or
                        facilitate a workshop. Section 26.4.1 refers to the five preparation steps needed to run a
                        successful workshop and the same steps apply to a retrospective. There are many suggested
                        formats and many tools and techniques available. A retrospective would have a similar structure
                        to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Objective</strong> This could be very specific to a certain area or more broadly based</li>
                        <li><strong>Attendees</strong> Usually this would just be the team and all of them should be present</li>
                        <li><strong>Agenda</strong> Needs to be adjusted to suit the situation (see section 19.4.1.3)</li>
                        <li><strong>Logistics</strong> The same as for any workshop (e.g. layout, materials, refreshments)</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-reading</strong> Distributing key information and results in advance can result in a faster start
                            to the retrospective and therefore it takes less time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>19.4.1.3 Agenda</h4>
                    <p>Many techniques exist to capture lessons (or ‘learnings’) but typically a retrospective will
                        involve an agenda with the following steps in some form:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agreeing the objective, agenda and any house rules</li>
                        <li>Reflecting on what has happened in terms of actual results and measures (e.g. 42 story
                            points were delivered, 7 defects were found)
                        </li>
                        <li>Generating views on what went well and what didn’t go so well</li>
                        <li>Actions on what to do next time, who is responsible for each one and when they are due to be
                            completed
                        </li>
                        <li>Close.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>19.4.1.4 Hints that may prove useful</h4>
                    <p>Including someone from project support in a retrospective could be useful to capture the lessons
                        in order to transfer the learnings across projects and the organization as a whole. The team
                        would need to be comfortable with this, as they may prefer to pass on their findings after the
                        retrospective.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally, key documents and artefacts could be specifically reviewed (e.g. the definition of
                        ‘done’ or working agreements).</p>
                    <p>It is often a good idea to ensure that only a few changes to the process are suggested at each
                        retrospective, as opposed to working on too many improvements at the same time. In other words
                        it is better to produce two actions from a retrospective that are actioned, because the work
                        involved is easy for the team to take on, as opposed to ten actions which can psychologically
                        seem like too much extra work for a team, and therefore not worth starting. Feedback can be prioritized using a simple classification system of ‘high, medium and low’
                        or by plotting the feedback on an impact/effort grid (which contains two axes that show the effect of the
                        change and the amount of work involved in it).</p>

                            This is a feedback technique that can be used by a team in a retrospective. Each team
                            member writes one or more sticky notes and puts them into the appropriate column. This
                            lets everyone else know what made them ‘glad’ during the last timebox, what made them
                            ‘sad’ and what even made them ‘mad’ (see Figure 19.2)!

                    <p>A final step in a retrospective could be to reflect on how well the retrospective process worked.
                        Put another way it would be a retrospective retrospective!</p>
                    <p>Even if a team has become very good at doing retrospectives in a certain way, it can be worth
                        introducing new techniques to keep people’s creativity fresh.</p>
                    <p>Introducing an independent facilitator can be very effective. If the group does not choose this
                        option then the person leading the retrospective should still be facilitative.</p>
                    <p>To introduce some variety to retrospectives it may be worth using some of them to look for
                        improvements on specific areas of the process, whereas other retrospectives may have no specific
                        area of focus.</p>
                    <p>Involving the people who use the process in improving the process ensures that there is buy-in to
                        any changes, and that any change is permanent.</p>
                    <p>Kanban would refer to retrospectives as service delivery reviews at a team level, and operations
                        reviews at a higher level, but they can be run in the same style or similar.</p>
                    <p>During a retrospective, feedback usually comes in two forms: facts and feelings. Sometimes it is
                        beneficial to separate feedback when it covers both of these (e.g. having separate steps in the
                        agenda). Facts are usually objective and measurable, such as ‘the customer was not available
                        during week two’. Feelings are usually subjective and harder to quantify, such as ‘I felt let
                        down by the release team as they promised me they would be ready’. It is the latter that is more
                        likely to cause emotional responses and possibly conflict during a retrospective.</p>
                    <h4>19.4.1.5 Learn gradually</h4>
                    <p>Identifying lessons and learning from them are two different matters. This is why a retrospective
                        needs to carefully draw out the learnings from a group, analyse them and then distil them into
                        decisions and actions that ensure the continual improvement of the process and the way the team
                        works. This can then be recorded in the lessons log.</p>
                    <p>The best way to improve how a team works is little by little, and little and often. This applies
                        to a sprint, a release, a stage or the whole project.</p>
                    <h2>19.5 SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>A project manager controlling a project by stages is an important concept in PRINCE2 as it is
                        part of management by exception and helps to ensure the ongoing viability of a project.</p>
                    <p>When using PRINCE2 in an agile environment the project manager should empower the delivery teams
                        to deliver in the best way possible, by being collaborative with work assignment that is based
                        around features and making full use of visual communication channels. Further to this, the use
                        of regular reviews and retrospectives along with setting the appropriate tolerances creates an
                        environment where creativity and responding to change exist in order to best address the
                        customer’s needs.</p>
