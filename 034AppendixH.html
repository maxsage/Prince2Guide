                    <h1>The Scrum Guide™</h1>
                    <h2>PURPOSE OF THE SCRUM GUIDE</h2>
                    <p>Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. This Guide contains the
                        definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules
                        that bind them together. Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum; the Scrum Guide is
                        written and provided by them. Together, they stand behind the Scrum Guide.</p>
                    <h2>DEFINITION OF SCRUM</h2>
                    <p>Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while
                        productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.</p>
                    <p>Scrum is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lightweight</li>
                        <li>Simple to understand</li>
                        <li>Difficult to master</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the
                        early 1990s. Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a
                        framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the
                        relative efficacy of your product management and development practices so that you can
                        improve.</p>
                    <p>The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and
                        rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s
                        success and usage.</p>
                    <p>The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships
                        and interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this
                        document.</p>
                    <p>Specific tactics for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.</p>
                    <h2>SCRUM THEORY</h2>
                    <p>Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
                        knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an
                        iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.</p>
                    <p>Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection,
                        and adaptation.</p>
                    <h3>Transparency</h3>
                    <p>Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
                        Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common
                        understanding of what is being seen.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,</li>
                        <li>Those performing the work and those accepting the work product must share a common
                            definition of “Done”.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Inspection</h3>
                    <p>Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
                        undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the
                        way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors
                        at the point of work.</p>
                    <h3>Adaptation</h3>
                    <p>If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable
                        limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being
                        processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further
                        deviation.</p>
                    <p>Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum
                        Events section of this document:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sprint Planning</li>
                        <li>Daily Scrum</li>
                        <li>Sprint Review</li>
                        <li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>THE SCRUM TEAM</h2>
                    <p>The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams
                        are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish
                        their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have
                        all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.
                        The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.</p>
                    <p>Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for
                        feedback. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of
                        working product is always available.</p>
                    <h3>The Product Owner</h3>
                    <p>The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the
                        Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and
                        individuals. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
                        Product Backlog management includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;</li>
                        <li>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;</li>
                        <li>Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;</li>

                        <li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what
                            the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
                        </li>
                        <li>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level
                            needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product
                        Owner remains accountable.</p>
                    <p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of
                        a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s
                        priority must address the Product Owner.</p>
                    <p>For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The
                        Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one
                        is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the
                        Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.</p>
                    <h3>The Development Team</h3>
                    <p>The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
                        releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the
                        Development Team create the Increment.</p>
                    <p>Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their
                        own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and
                        effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>Development Teams have the following characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how
                            to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
                        </li>
                        <li>Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create
                            a product Increment;
                        </li>
                        <li>Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of
                            the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;
                        </li>
                        <li>Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of particular domains that
                            need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this
                            rule; and,
                        </li>
                        <li>Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
                            accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Development Team Size</h3>
                    <p>Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete
                        significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction
                        and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill
                        constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a
                        potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination.
                        Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage. The
                        Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also
                        executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.</p>
                    <h3>The Scrum Master</h3>
                    <p>The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do
                        this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.</p>
                    <p>The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the
                        Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which
                        aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created
                        by the Scrum Team.</p>
                    <h3>Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner</h3>
                    <p>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;</li>
                        <li>Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;</li>
                        <li>Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;</li>
                        <li>Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;</li>
                        <li>Understanding and practicing agility; and,</li>
                        <li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Scrum Master Service to the Development Team</h3>
                    <p>The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;</li>
                        <li>Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;</li>
                        <li>Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;</li>
                        <li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; and,</li>
                        <li>Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully
                            adopted and understood.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Scrum Master Service to the Organization</h3>
                    <p>The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;</li>
                        <li>Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;</li>
                        <li>Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product
                            development;
                        </li>
                        <li>Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,</li>
                        <li>Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum
                            in the organization.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>SCRUM EVENTS</h2>
                    <p>Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings
                        not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum
                        duration. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The
                        remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate
                        amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.</p>
                    <p>Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a
                        formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to
                        enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in
                        reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.</p>
                    <h3>The Sprint</h3>
                    <p>The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable,
                        and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints best have consistent durations
                        throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the
                        previous Sprint.</p>
                    <p>Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the
                        Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.</p>
                    <p>During the Sprint:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;</li>
                        <li>Quality goals do not decrease; and,</li>
                        <li>Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as
                            more is learned.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects,
                        Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a
                        design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.</p>
                    <p>Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of
                        what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable
                        predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least
                        every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.</p>
                    <h3>Cancelling a Sprint</h3>
                    <p>A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the
                        authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the
                        stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.</p>
                    <p>A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company
                        changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be
                        cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short duration of
                        Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.</p>
                    <p>When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part
                        of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete
                        Product Backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on
                        them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.</p>
                    <p>Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone has to regroup in another Sprint Planning
                        to start another Sprint. Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are
                        very uncommon.</p>
                    <h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
                    <p>The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by
                        the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.</p>
                    <p>Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter
                        Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and
                        that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it
                        within the time-box.</p>
                    <p>Sprint Planning answers the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?</li>
                        <li>How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?</h3>
                    <p>The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the
                        Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product
                        Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum
                        Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.</p>
                    <p>The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected
                        capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development
                        Team. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the
                        Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming
                        Sprint.</p>
                    <p>After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the
                        Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the
                        Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the
                        Development Team on why it is building the Increment.</p>
                    <h3>Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?</h3>
                    <p>Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development
                        Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done” product Increment during the
                        Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is
                        called the Sprint Backlog.</p>
                    <p>The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the
                        Product Backlog into a working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated
                        effort. However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development Team to
                        forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned for the first days of
                        the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of
                        one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint
                        Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.</p>
                    <p>The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. If
                        the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the
                        selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite
                        other people to attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product
                        Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint
                        Goal and create the anticipated Increment.</p>
                    <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
                    <p>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of
                        Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the
                        Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the
                        Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The
                        selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The
                        Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather
                        than on separate initiatives.</p>
                    <p>As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint
                        Goal, it implements the functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than
                        the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of
                        Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.</p>
                    <h3>Daily Scrum</h3>
                    <p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize
                        activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since
                        the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one. The Daily
                        Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting, the
                        Development Team members explain:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
                        <li>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
                        <li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint
                            Goal?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to
                        inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily
                        Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every day,
                        the Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team
                        to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint. The
                        Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed
                        discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.</p>
                    <p>The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is
                        responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to
                        keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.</p>
                    <p>The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily
                        Scrum.</p>
                    <p>Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to
                        development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the
                        Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting.</p>
                    <h3>Sprint Review</h3>
                    <p>A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product
                        Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about
                        what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the
                        Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is
                        an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to
                        elicit feedback and foster collaboration.</p>
                    <p>This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is
                        usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants
                        understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within the time-box. The Sprint
                        Review includes the following elements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;</li>
                        <li>The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been
                            “Done”;
                        </li>
                        <li>The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into,
                            and how those problems were solved;
                        </li>
                        <li>The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about
                            the Increment;
                        </li>
                        <li>The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely
                            completion dates based on progress to date (if needed);
                        </li>
                        <li>The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides
                            valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
                        </li>
                        <li>Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the
                            most valuable thing to do next; and,
                        </li>
                        <li>Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next
                            anticipated release of the product.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product
                        Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new
                        opportunities.</p>
                    <h3>Sprint Retrospective</h3>
                    <p>The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
                        for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.</p>
                    <p>The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
                        This is a three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is
                        usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants
                        understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within the time-box. The Scrum
                        Master participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum
                        process.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and
                            tools;
                        </li>
                        <li>Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,</li>
                        <li>Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process framework, its
                        development process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for the next Sprint.
                        During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product quality by
                        adapting the definition of “Done” as appropriate.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that
                        it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the
                        adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented
                        at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and
                        adaptation.</p>
                    <h2>SCRUM ARTIFACTS</h2>
                    <p>Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for
                        inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize
                        transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the
                        artifact.</p>
                    <h3>Product Backlog</h3>
                    <p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is
                        the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner
                        is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.</p>
                    <p>A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially
                        known and best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the
                        environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly
                        changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. As long
                        as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.</p>
                    <p>The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that
                        constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have
                        the attributes of a description, order, estimate and value.</p>
                    <p>As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog
                        becomes a larger and more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product
                        Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business requirements, market conditions, or technology
                        may cause changes in the Product Backlog.</p>
                    <p>Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to
                        describe the upcoming work on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items may
                        then be employed.</p>
                    <p>Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the
                        Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team
                        collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items
                        are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement
                        usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product
                        Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s
                        discretion.</p>
                    <p>Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered
                        ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the
                        lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team
                        for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be “Done” within the
                        Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within one
                        Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning. Product Backlog items usually
                        acquire this degree of transparency through the above described refining activities.</p>
                    <p>The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the
                        Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform
                        the work make the final estimate.</p>
                    <h3>Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal</h3>
                    <p>At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner
                        tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this
                        amount with work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing
                        projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information is made transparent to all
                        stakeholders.</p>
                    <p>Various projective practices upon trending have been used to forecast progress, like burn-downs,
                        burn-ups, or cumulative flows. These have proven useful. However, these do not replace the
                        importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has
                        happened may be used for forwardlooking decision-making.</p>
                    <h3>Sprint Backlog</h3>
                    <p>The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for
                        delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast
                        by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work
                        needed to deliver that functionality into a “Done” Increment.</p>
                    <p>The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as
                        necessary to meet the Sprint Goal.</p>
                    <p>The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the
                        Daily Scrum. The Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the
                        Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This emergence occurs as the Development Team works
                        through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal.</p>
                    <p>As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed
                        or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed
                        unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a
                        Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the
                        Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development
                        Team.</p>
                    <h3>Monitoring Sprint Progress</h3>
                    <p>At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed.
                        The Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project
                        the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the
                        Sprint, the Development Team can manage its progress.</p>
                    <h3>Increment</h3>
                    <p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value
                        of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be
                        “Done”, which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of
                        “Done”. It must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to
                        actually release it.</p>
                    <h2>ARTIFACT TRANSPARENCY</h2>
                    <p>Scrum relies on transparency. Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the
                        perceived state of the artifacts. To the extent that transparency is complete, these decisions
                        have a sound basis. To the extent that the artifacts are incompletely transparent, these
                        decisions can be flawed, value may diminish and risk may increase.</p>
                    <p>The Scrum Master must work with the Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved parties
                        to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent. There are practices for coping with
                        incomplete transparency; the Scrum Master must help everyone apply the most appropriate
                        practices in the absence of complete transparency. A Scrum Master can detect incomplete
                        transparency by inspecting the artifacts, sensing patterns, listening closely to what is being
                        said, and detecting differences between expected and real results.</p>
                    <p>The Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the
                        transparency of the artifacts. This work usually involves learning, convincing, and change.
                        Transparency doesn’t occur overnight, but is a path.</p>
                    <h3>Definition of “Done”</h3>
                    <p>When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what
                        “Done” means. Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared
                        understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the
                        definition of “Done” for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the
                        product Increment.</p>
                    <p>The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can
                        select during a Sprint Planning. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of
                        potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of
                        “Done”. Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This
                        Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it. If the definition
                        of “done” for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the
                        development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If “done” for an
                        increment is not a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum
                        Team must define a definition of “done” appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum
                        Teams working on the system or product release, the Development Teams on all of the Scrum Teams
                        must mutually define the definition of “Done”.</p>
                    <p>Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all
                        Increments work together.</p>
                    <p>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include
                        more stringent criteria for higher quality. Any one product or system should have a definition
                        of “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it.</p>
                    <h2>END NOTE</h2>
                    <p>Scrum is free and offered in this Guide. Scrum’s roles, artifacts, events, and rules are
                        immutable and although implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.
                        Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques,
                        methodologies, and practices.</p>
                    <h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
                    <h3>People</h3>
                    <p>Of the thousands of people who have contributed to Scrum, we should single out those who were
                        instrumental in its first ten years. First there was Jeff Sutherland working with Jeff McKenna,
                        and Ken Schwaber working with Mike Smith and Chris Martin. Many others contributed in the
                        ensuing years and without their help Scrum would not be refined as it is today.</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland first co-presented Scrum at the OOPSLA conference in 1995. This
                        presentation essentially documented the learning that Ken and Jeff gained over the previous few
                        years applying Scrum.</p>
                    <p>The history of Scrum is already considered long. To honor the first places where it was tried and
                        refined, we recognize Individual, Inc., Fidelity Investments, and IDX (now GE Medical).</p>
                    <p>The Scrum Guide documents Scrum as developed and sustained for 20-plus years by Jeff Sutherland
                        and Ken Schwaber. Other sources provide you with patterns, processes, and insights that
                        complement the Scrum framework. These optimize productivity, value, creativity, and pride</p>
