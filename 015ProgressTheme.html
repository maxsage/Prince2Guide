                <h2>15.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE PROGRESS THEME</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the Progress theme is to establish mechanisms to monitor and compare actual
                    achievements against those planned; provide a forecast for the project objectives and the project’s
                    continued viability; and control any unacceptable deviations.</p>
                <p>Two of the principles of PRINCE2 are managing by stages and continued business justification. The
                    Progress theme provides the mechanisms for monitoring and control, enabling the critical assessment
                    of ongoing viability.</p>
                <p>The Progress theme provides such mechanisms for all management levels (delivering, managing,
                    directing) within the project management team, and for corporate or programme management outside the
                    project.</p>
                <h3>15.1.1 What is progress?</h3>
                <p>Progress is the measure of the achievement of the objectives of a plan. It can be monitored at work
                    package, stage and project level.</p>
                <h3>15.1.2 What are progress controls?</h3>
                <p>Progress controls ensure that for each level of the project management team the next level of
                    management can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor progress</li>
                    <li>Compare level of achievement with plan</li>
                    <li>Review plans and options against future situations</li>
                    <li>Detect problems and identify risks</li>
                    <li>Initiate corrective action</li>
                    <li>Authorize further work.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>15.1.3 Exceptions and tolerances</h3>
                <p>An exception is a situation where it can be forecast that there will be a deviation beyond the agreed
                    tolerance levels.</p>
                <p>Tolerances are the permissible deviation above and below a plan’s target for time and cost without
                    escalating the deviation to the next level of management. There may also be tolerance levels for
                    quality, scope, benefit and risk.</p>
                <p>Progress control involves measuring actual progress against the performance targets of time, cost,
                    quality, scope, benefits and risk, and then using this information to make decisions (such as
                    whether to approve a stage or work package, whether to escalate deviations, whether to prematurely
                    close the project etc.) and to take actions as required</p>
                <h2>15.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRESS THEME</h2>
                <p>In a similar way to the Plans theme, agile sees the Progress theme as of particular importance and
                    many agile concepts and techniques exist to address the need to track progress. Although most of
                    this is focused at the delivery level, more mature agile environments use these techniques in a
                    wider context where there is a need to see how a piece of work relates to other teams or other
                    projects and what value is being delivered as a whole.</p>
                <p>Agile typically tracks the progress of the amount of work being completed and the amount of value
                    being delivered. Ideally this value is provided to real customers in an operational environment.</p>
                <p>It is important to understand that agile monitors and controls the work being carried out as much
                    through some of its fundamental values and not just the use of specific techniques. Burn charts and
                    work-in-progress boards are very common techniques used in agile, and although they are very
                    effective in their own right, they actually form part of a bigger picture in that they help enshrine
                    some of the key agile values such as transparency, simplicity and empiricism. People new to agile
                    often see these displays first, and not only do they look appealing, they are also very
                    effective.</p>
                <p>Fundamental to the agile way of working is the desire to respond quickly to learnings and new
                    information. By working iteratively there is a great sense of immediacy to this responsiveness and
                    agile aims to create the conditions where progress is monitored ‘real time’.</p>
                <h2>15.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE FOR THE PROGRESS THEME</h2>
                <p>Both PRINCE2 and agile provide an abundance of guidance on tracking progress. There is nothing
                    contradictory between the two. However, there are different areas of emphasis and when combining
                    PRINCE2 with agile it is important to draw on the strengths of both to create a strong blend that
                    provides comprehensive coverage in all areas and at all levels of a project.</p>
                <p>When using PRINCE2 with agile, flexibility in what is delivered is the primary aspect of performance
                    that is of most interest to the whole project management team; therefore displaying this in the form
                    of a burn chart is quite natural irrespective of the project level.</p>
                <p>It is also quite natural for a project manager to know that they will need to react quickly to how
                    things are progressing as it may take several sprints or releases to understand how much work is
                    going to be delivered by tracking overall velocity</p>
                <h3>15.3.1 Control</h3>
                <p>Whenever an organization invests time and money into a project it is essential that this investment
                    is monitored and controlled appropriately. Although common phraseology, such as the use of the terms
                    ‘progress’ (in PRINCE2) and ‘velocity’ (in agile), gives a positive feel when helping to answer the
                    question ‘How are things going?’, it should not be overlooked that behind all of the techniques and
                    concepts lies the necessity to be in control at all times. The word ‘control’ does not resonate well
                    with many in the agile community as they see it as inferring ‘command and control’. This is
                    certainly not the case as PRINCE2 is more focused on creating guiding boundaries that empower people
                    to carry out their work by self-organizing. PRINCE2 creates these boundaries by using such things as
                    tolerances (as well as stage boundaries and the role of project assurance), and if these are
                    forecast to be exceeded, it will trigger an exception. This then acts as a safety net to catch a
                    situation that has gone outside what was reasonable to expect.</p>
                <h3>15.3.2 Progress at different levels</h3>
                <p>PRINCE2 tracks progress at different levels (see Figure 12.3) and many techniques can be used at any
                    level. Using only agile techniques for delivery and only traditional techniques for direction and
                    management would be limiting, as many of the agile concepts and techniques can prove effective at
                    all levels for tracking progress. Care may need to be taken as the audience for any technique will
                    need to be comfortable with the information it is conveying (e.g. to use a burn-down chart for the
                    project board may prove counter-productive if the project board members are not familiar with this
                    format). However, many of the PRINCE2 products can be created by using agile artefacts. For
                    example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An agile technique used at the direction level On a PRINCE2 project where scope and quality
                        criteria are variable, it is often good practice to communicate progress to the project board by
                        way of a graphical burn chart showing how much has been successfully completed against what had
                        been forecast. Adding the tolerance levels for the scope may enhance the graphic further.
                    </li>
                    <li>A PRINCE2 theme at the delivery level On a project using timeboxing, it is recommended to first
                        define the stage boundaries, and then to build in the appropriate number of releases and/or
                        sprints (of suitable length) inside each stage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In either example progress is typically tracked by completed products (as opposed to days or
                    hours).</p>
                <h2>15.4 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                <h3>15.4.1 Burn charts</h3>
                <p>One of the most popular techniques used in agile environments is to display progress using lines
                    plotted on a graph. These graphs are known as burn charts and they come in two forms: burn-down
                    charts and burn-up charts (see Figure 15.1).</p>
                <h4>15.4.1.1 The basics</h4>
                <p>Burn-down charts are the most well known and they are used to show how much work remains whereas
                    burn-up charts are slightly more complex and they are used to show how much work has been done. Both
                    types of chart aim to provide two important pieces of information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the situation regarding progress – i.e. what is the current situation and what should it
                        be?
                    </li>
                    <li>At the current rate of progress what will be the situation at the end of this time period (which
                        could be a sprint, release, stage, project or any other period of time)?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Typically the vertical axis shows the amount of work to do in terms of effort and the horizontal axis
                    shows time in some form such as days or dates.</p>
                <h4>15.4.1.2 How a burn-down chart works</h4>
                <p>In its most simple form the burn-down chart has two lines (see Figure 15.1). A straight line that
                    shows where the ‘ideal’ rate of progress should be (in black on the figure) and a line that is
                    updated on a regular basis (usually daily) that shows the amount of work done (in purple on the
                    figure). The work remaining is shown by the end of the purple line. When the purple line is above
                    the black line this means that work is behind schedule. If the purple line is below the black line
                    this means that work is ahead of schedule.</p>
                <p>The current rate of progress can be determined by the trend of the line (i.e. its gradient) showing
                    effort remaining. This is commonly referred to as ‘velocity’ by the agile community. Assuming that
                    there is stability and constancy in the team, this can then be used to project forward and forecast
                    when the work will be complete and importantly determine if the deadline is likely to be met.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Figure15-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                    <figcaption>Fig 15-001 </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3>15.4.1.3 How a burn-up chart works</h3>
                <p>One limitation with burn-down charts is that they assume the amount of work doesn’t change. This is
                    not a significant limitation in most situations (e.g. where a two-week sprint has been agreed and
                    locked-in/ baselined) but if the amount of work is likely to change, or does change, then this will
                    not be picked up by a burn-down chart easily, and therefore a burn-up chart should be used (see
                    Figure 15.1). The purple line shows work completed, which can now be used in tandem with the red
                    line showing the total amount of work. The work remaining is therefore the difference between the
                    red and purple lines. Any work that has been added or removed during the time period can now be seen
                    by the red line.</p>
                <h4>15.4.1.4 Further information</h4>
                <p>The reason why burn charts are so prevalent in agile environments is because agile is based on what
                    is (or is not) being delivered and where time and the team size are fixed. Therefore to monitor
                    progress, an agile delivery team (or team manager or project manager) will focus on what, of the
                    planned work for a specific time period, has been completed. Depending on the level at which this
                    work is taking place this could refer to such things as requirements, user stories or tasks.</p>
                <p>The recommended way to display a burn chart is for it to be physically mounted on a wall or board and
                    updated manually. This intentionally creates a simple and tactile way of showing and interacting
                    with the information regarding progress. It is not always possible to do this, such as when teams
                    are distributed. However, the temptation to move to capturing and displaying the information
                    electronically should be taken carefully as the benefits of the technology may not outweigh those of
                    the physical engagement created by the tactile experience.</p>
                <h4>15.4.1.5 Hints that may prove useful</h4>
                <p>When updating a burn chart, only record information according to completed work. If a two-day task is
                    50% complete do not mark anything as completed on the burn chart. The same applies even if it is 95%
                    complete. Burn charts are less accurate if the size of the tasks being reported on are relatively
                    large for the given time period (e.g. a five-day task in a two-week sprint). When working in an
                    agile way it may be appropriate for teams working in sprints (which should last no more than four
                    weeks) to break down tasks to a size that needs only a few days of effort or less. Primarily this is
                    needed in order to help make it easier for a team to organize its work. A desirable side-effect of
                    this is to make burn charts more sensitive (to issues/impediments) and accurate. However, there is
                    an overhead with this as time needs to be spent breaking down work into smaller work items.</p>
                <p>Either type of burn chart can be used in a wide variety of situations throughout a project. They can
                    be applied to anything that involves time lasting from a few hours, to many months or years.</p>
                <p>Make sure the axes reflect the correct units being used. The left-hand axis will typically show
                    effort in the form of points such as story points. However, this needs to reflect the units used
                    when the work was estimated.</p>
                <h2>15.4.2 Information radiators</h2>
                <p>When entering a room where an agile team is working you would expect to see lots of information
                    displayed on the walls or boards and you would also expect to see this information conveyed in a
                    ‘low-tech‘ style with the abundant use of sticky notes, large sheets of paper, colour, symbols,
                    pictures and graphics.</p>
                <h3>15.4.2.1 The basics</h3>
                <p>One of the best ways to convey most information is visually, and if this can be accessed quickly then
                    this is even better. If a room contains large sheets of paper or large whiteboards and the
                    information on them can be seen clearly from a distance, then this creates a ‘push’ of information
                    that can be accessed immediately. If information is held on someone’s desk or computer it is not
                    immediately accessible and also needs to be ‘pulled’.</p>
                <p>Further to this, and of similar importance, the creation and maintenance of this information is best
                    carried out manually – i.e. physically writing on charts and moving sticky notes. This can happen
                    very quickly and in any format or style that is felt to be appropriate. For example spontaneous
                    annotations and informal codes and symbols such as ticks, crosses, red dots, green stars etc. can be
                    used. Although this can be achieved electronically, and perhaps it can be printed off, this takes
                    longer and can be seen as being sterile and not as engaging as the ‘low-tech’ option.</p>

                <h3>15.4.2.2 Further information</h3>
                <p>Transparency (or visibility) is one of the key behaviours that is at the heart of most agile
                    approaches. It is a hugely significant part of agile and the use of visible information,
                    handcrafted, simple to understand and instantly available to digest, contributes significantly in
                    this area. The idea is to make information visible to all and understood by all. However there is a
                    risk that comes with this. In order to be fully, or truly, transparent all information about a
                    project needs to be visible and that includes displaying information that may at times be negative
                    as well as positive. This is where another key behaviour which is also at the heart of most agile
                    approaches (and perhaps at the heart of manage by exception) can be enhanced: that value being
                    trust. The opposite of this is when the information is massaged which is sometimes referred to as
                    ‘gaming’.</p>
                <h3>15.4.2.3 Hints that may prove useful</h3>
                <p>A good guide to help with deciding on the correct size, format and layout of anything being displayed
                    is to see if the information can be digested by someone walking past. Put another way, does someone
                    need to leave their desk and walk over to the information in order to be able to read it? This is
                    why words like ‘big’ and ‘large’ are used to describe these figures and charts. Many people use the
                    abbreviation BVC which stands for ‘big visible chart’.</p>
                <p>A wide variety of information can be displayed using this approach. The most commonly displayed
                    information relates to work and how it is progressing (e.g. a burn-down chart or a WIP
                    (work-in-progress) board). Other information commonly displayed would cover quality and defects,
                    risks and issues, vision statements (or similar) and working practices (see Figure 15.2).</p>
                <p>Information displayed this way needs to be regularly updated and it won’t update itself! Holding a
                    daily stand-up meeting by these displays, and moving the information across immediately, is one way
                    to achieve this.</p>

                <p>If a project management team is not co-located this is hard to recreate, but technology, webcams,
                    digital photography and virtual systems can go part of the way to achieving some of the benefits
                    that this brings to how the team communicates.</p>
                <p>Don’t underestimate the positive impression these graphs and charts give off simply by their
                    attractive appearance!</p>
                <h2>15.5 PROGRESS THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>Progress on a project can be assessed in several ways and at several levels. PRINCE2 Agile monitors
                    many areas of the project such as whether or not the business case will be met, or how many features
                    have been delivered so far in a particular sprint.</p>
                <p>When combining PRINCE2 and agile, the different levels of planning a project need to show progress in
                    a form that is suitable for the audience looking at the information or looking to monitor and
                    control the situation. The most effective use of PRINCE2 and agile is achieved when progress is
                    managed within an appropriate set of responsive and flexible tolerances that cover the six aspects
                    of the PRINCE2 Agile hexagon (see Figure 6.1).</p>

                <p>One of the principles of PRINCE2 is to manage by exception; therefore, to have transparency of how a
