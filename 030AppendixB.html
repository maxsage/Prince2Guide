                    <p>In PRINCE2 there are nine roles which are defined with specific responsibilities. They relate to
                        project direction, project management and project delivery, although in the case of project
                        delivery, PRINCE2 only refers to the team manager and not the members of the delivery team.</p>
                    <p>Appendix C of Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2 includes comprehensive descriptions for
                        these roles and they are summarized here in Table B.1.</p>

                                    achieve the forecast benefits. The executive has to ensure that the project gives
                                    value for money, ensuring a cost-conscious approach to the project, balancing the

                                    may require more than one person to cover all the user interests. For the sake of
                                    effectiveness, the role should not be split between too many people.</p>
                                <p>The senior user(s) specifies the benefits and is held to account by demonstrating to

                    <p>In PRINCE2 Agile a set of delivery roles have been defined so that they can be used if
                        appropriate, or they can be used to understand what may be expected of a delivery team using
                        agile. These are described in Table B.2.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that roles are not the same as job titles. A role on a project is temporary
                        and is carried out by one or more individuals. Someone could be carrying out several roles on
                        several projects. A job title is different from this in that it is usually defined by a job
                        description and represents a person’s role in an organization (e.g. engineer, administrator,
                        tester, designer etc.)</p>
