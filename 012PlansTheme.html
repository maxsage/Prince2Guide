                    <h2>12.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE PLANS THEME</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Plans theme is to facilitate communication and control by defining the means
                        of delivering the products (the where and how, by whom, and estimating the when and how
                        much).</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 recommends three levels of plan to reflect the needs of the different levels of
                        management involved in the project, stage and team.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2’s planning levels are illustrated in Figure 12.1.</p>
                    <h2>12.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE PLANS THEME</h2>
                    <p>Agile puts a lot of emphasis on planning, and there are several concepts and techniques (e.g.
                        planning and estimating with story points) that could be said to be common to the agile way of
                        working. However, not only are there significant differences between agile and conventional
                        approaches to planning, there are also differences between the various agile frameworks. This
                        means that there are choices to be made when planning, and care is needed to use the most
                        appropriate approach to suit the situation.</p>
                    <h3>12.2.1 Empiricism</h3>
                    <p>A fundamental principle upon which most agile methods are based is the concept of empiricism. This
                        involves making decisions based on experience – i.e. what is happening or has already happened.
                        A simple example of this would be to start a piece of work and then calculate how much work is
                        left to complete by comparing it with how much work is getting done. This then allows the team
                        to forecast or create an end date.</p>
                    <p>Starting work and seeing how much is getting done is sometimes called ‘calibration’ (in a similar
                        way to manually setting weighing scales to zero), or calculating ‘velocity’ (i.e. the rate of
                        progress). Another expression used to encapsulate this is ‘using yesterday’s weather’ as it can
                        often be the best indicator of what is to follow. Future estimates are then based on this.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure12-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 12-001 PRINCE2's planning levels</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The opposite of this is called ‘rationalism’ whereby reasoning or logic is used to make
                        predictions and plan what should happen.</p>
                    <p>In a BAU context empirical planning is a common agile technique and works well in an environment
                        where work is ongoing. This means that when planning a two-week sprint, the primary information
                        to use would be that of the previous sprint and the sprints prior to that.</p>
                    <h3>12.2.2 Planning style</h3>
                    <p>Agile plans are often created in a particular style which involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basing planning around requirements and features</li>
                        <li>Making planning a team-based exercise</li>
                        <li>Planning at the last responsible moment (also known as JIT or just-in-time planning).</li></ul>
                    <p>The first point means that the focus of any agile plan is on what features are being delivered as
                        opposed to focusing on technical phases such as design, build and test (see section 2.1).</p>
                    <p>The second point is a vital component of the agile mind-set that creates ownership of plans and
                        underpins the ability of a team to self-organize. In some agile environments this may only
                        happen at the delivery level. A project would be seen as more agile if the same ethos applied to
                        plans created at the project management and project direction levels.</p>
                    <p>The third point enables a team to adapt easily to changing circumstances by planning as near as
                        possible to the point where a product is being created. However, care is needed to avoid taking
                        unnecessary risks by leaving decisions too late or procrastinating.</p>
                    <p>Agile planning can be very effective even though it is sometimes quite simple and low-tech, such
                        as a simple list which is referred to as a backlog. The aim is to do the right amount of
                        planning at the right time.</p>
                    <h3>12.2.3 Using points to plan</h3>
                    <p>As agile has evolved over the years many people have moved from controlling their work with a
                        timeboxing approach (e.g. Scrum) to using flow-based systems through the use of Kanban (see
                        Figure 12.2). This has created choice for agile teams whereby teams can use a point-scoring
                        system to negotiate and plan (e.g. effort points per story), or they can choose to forecast
                        according to such things as lead times (i.e. how long it takes a piece of work of this type to
                        complete). There are advantages and disadvantages when using points in their many forms, so care
                        should be taken to use them appropriately as described in the guidance later in section
                        12.4.1.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that the use of ‘points’ for estimation is seen by some as fundamental to
                        working in an agile way. Although they are still popular and still useful, they should be seen
                        as ‘a way’ and not ‘the way’ (see section 12.4.1). A middle ground is often used whereby a
                        simple form of estimation is used where work is classified as either large, medium or small, or
                        high, medium and low, and this can be used with either a timeboxed or flow-based approach.</p>
                    <h2>12.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE FOR THE PLANS THEME</h2>
                    <p>PRINCE2 supports any type of planning style from a conventional Gantt chart to a simple backlog
                        list. Both styles are in keeping with the product description for a plan (see Appendix A.16). It
                        may be the case that more than one planning style is used on a single project. There may be a
                        tendency to use more conventional planning techniques for the higher levels of planning (e.g.
                        where departmental and organizational dependencies may exist) but this may not be necessary.
                        When using PRINCE2 in an agile environment a Gantt chart can be of limited value as it is not
                        geared to monitor and control the amount of products delivered and their quality.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure12-002.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 12-002 Timeboxed versus flow-based working</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>12.3.1 Collaborative planning</h3>
                    <p>Agile planning is collaborative, for all types of plan and at all levels, and this is desirable
                        in order to create an environment where the people involved in a project can respond to changing
                        circumstances. If a group of people are working to a plan that was created by someone else (e.g.
                        the project manager) there is likely to be less commitment and responsiveness.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that the role of the project manager or team manager is any less important,
                        but it does mean that they need to facilitate this style of planning.</p>
                    <h3>12.3.2 Using empiricism to plan</h3>
                    <p>Empiricism has many advantages, and to use PRINCE2 in an agile environment this needs to be fully
                        understood and embraced as far as is practicable. A potential drawback with some of the agile
                        planning techniques is that in a project context (where a project is finite), we need to
                        estimate and plan before we start and not after.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 needs a project plan with an end date for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It will enable the project to be justified and therefore authorized.</li>
                        <li>It will provide a baseline against which progress can be measured and stages defined.</li>
                        <li> Projects are finite pieces of work that are ‘bounded’; therefore without an end date
                            PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile would not see the work as a project.
                        </li>
                        <li>From a supplier perspective it enables them to give the customer a price and a delivery date.</li>
                        <li>It will show if a minimum viable product (MVP) can be created in time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Stage plans and team plans are similarly affected, albeit at a lower level.</p>
                    <h3>12.3.3 Planning horizons</h3>
                    <p>Having an end date is one thing, but how accurate and realistic it is can be something quite
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Both agile and PRINCE2 accept the premise that the further you look into the future the more
                        uncertainty there is. This means that longer-term estimation will need an increasing margin of
                        error compared with shorter-term estimation. This leads to the use of the term ‘planning
                        horizon’ whereby a plan for the next two weeks would be quite detailed and have a relatively low
                        margin of error, whereas a plan for the next 12 months would be much less detailed and have a
                        relatively high margin of error (see Figure 12.3).</p>
                    <p>Long-term planning addresses the uncertainties and unknowns (sometimes referred to as the ‘cone
                        of uncertainty’) by providing a level of confidence or a range with each estimate in the form of
                        agreed tolerances (see section 25.4).</p>
                    <p>Estimation and planning are seen as evolutionary when using agile and not a one-off activity.
                        They are carried out throughout the project and for every level of plan (see Table 12.1).</p>
                    <p>Empirical and <strong>emergent</strong> planning is more likely to occur in the lower levels of plan such as with
                        product delivery within the Managing Product Delivery process (i.e. where agile is predominantly
                        used) because the timescales (and therefore the planning horizons) will be short, perhaps in the
                        order of two to four weeks. The tasks at this level of plan will be so small (e.g. a matter of
                        days or hours) that feedback in the form of metrics will be frequent and planning will have a
                        relatively low margin of error. ‘Just-in-time’ (or JIT) planning at these low levels of plan is
                        sometimes referred to as ‘rolling-wave planning’ or ‘progressive elaboration’.</p>

                            Definition: Emergent<br>
                            A concept in agile that refers to creating solutions and making decisions in a way that
                            gradually converges on an accurate solution and doesn’t involve a lot of upfront work. The
                            opposite would be to spend time and try to predict how things will happen. An example
                            would be ‘emergent architecture’ whereby work could be started on the product and then
                            the best architecture would emerge as the product develops. The alternative would
                            involve doing a lot of work in advance to decide how the product would be built.

                    </div>
                    <p>A more predictive style of the planning would typically be applied for higher-level plans (e.g.
                        project plans and possibly stage plans) as these have a relatively higher margin of error.
                        However, empiricism can still be used at these levels, and it would be a good sign of an
                        organization’s maturity if measures and metrics from previous projects and stages were used to
                        estimate without a lot of ceremony.</p>
                    <p>Either way, over-planning should be avoided as it is not possible to cover and plan for every
                        eventuality. Therefore the attitude should be to do ‘enough’ planning and no more, otherwise the
                        extra work will outweigh the potential benefits as with the law of diminishing returns. The
                        Agile Manifesto puts emphasis on responding to change rather than following a plan.</p>
                    <h3>12.3.4 Align product-based planning to features</h3>
                    <p>One of the most powerful techniques in PRINCE2 is that of product-based planning, and this can be
                        applied very easily in agile situations. When creating a product breakdown structure or product
                        description the focus will typically be similar to the content of a requirement or user story.
                        It would not be appropriate to use technical phases during this exercise in an agile context
                        (e.g. analysis, design, build and test) as this is not the focus of the agile way of
                        working.</p>
                    <p>When using PRINCE2 in an agile context it is important to plan around features and groups of
                        features. Due to the primary focus of agile being based on flexing what is being delivered (see
                        Chapter 6) features expressed in the form of requirements or user stories represent the
                        contingency on a project when combining PRINCE2 with agile. Conversely, time and cost are not
                        used as contingency and are therefore likely to remain stable. Clearly illustrating what
                        constitutes the MVP is recommended.</p>
                    <p>Product-based planning can be used for any level of plan in PRINCE2. Perhaps at the lowest level
                        a team may prefer to use its own form of activity planning but the option to use product-based
                        planning should at least be considered.</p>
                    <h3>12.3.5 A possible limitation with sprint planning by priority only</h3>
                    <p>When working at the delivery level with agile, planning centres around the immediate future and
                        this often relates to a timebox of two to four weeks. Although flow-based approaches do not
                        typically use a timebox, both flow-based and iterative timeboxing approaches focus predominately
                        upon prioritization. That is to say the focus is on doing the highest-priority work as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>This is typified by sprint planning in Scrum (see Appendix H) whereby the highest-priority items
                        in the product backlog are broken down into tasks by the team that will be developing them. An
                        indication of a well-maintained product backlog is that each entry in the product backlog is
                        independent of any other entry, thus increasing the likelihood that work can be carried out by
                        any member of the team with the appropriate skills, without impacting on any of the others.
                        However, there will typically be limitations due to people having certain types of skill and
                        experience, and which people are available; therefore a balance will always need to be
                        struck.</p>
                    <p>Projects by their very nature are challenging, and therefore when planning at the levels above
                        the product delivery level it is usually too simplistic to create a prioritized to-do list and
                        start working from the top. Longer-term planning needs to consider many factors such as
                        dependencies (internal and external to the project) and the grouping together of similar work
                        items.</p>
                    <h2>12.4 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                    <h3>12.4.1 Agile estimation</h3>
                    <p>One of the most popular techniques used in agile environments is to estimate the work to be done
                        using a points system. This technique can be used for any type of plan in PRINCE2 (see ‘sprint
                        planning’ in Appendix H). Although the technique is reasonably straightforward and commonly
                        used, many of its advantages are not that obvious and sometimes overlooked.</p>
                    <h4>12.4.1.1 The basics</h4>
                    <p>The principal thinking behind this technique is to start estimating by using ‘relative’ estimates
                        (not ‘actual’ estimates) and to do this by harnessing the knowledge of the whole team in a way
                        that everyone can contribute without being prejudiced by other team members.</p>
                    <p>The most common form of relative estimation is achieved by giving requirements or user stories a
                        points value that means something relative to another requirement or user story. If painting a
                        wall was given a value of one point and painting a ceiling was given a value of two points, this
                        would mean that painting the ceiling would require twice the effort compared with painting the
                        wall. Importantly, this does not give any indication of how long either task will take, but it
                        does mean that if painting the wall turns out to take five days then painting the ceiling should
                        take something in the region of 10 days – assuming that we have made a correct relative
                        estimate.</p>
                    <p>Creating these relative estimates is carried out as a team, where each team member simultaneously
                        gives their opinion by using pre-numbered playing cards or pieces of paper showing their chosen
                        points value. The reason for using playing cards or similar is to avoid people having their
                        estimates affected or prejudiced by other people’s views. One area that can affect people’s
                        judgement is the tendency for people to put too much emphasis on the first estimate suggested.
                        This is known as ‘anchoring’.</p>
                    <p>When everyone reveals their points estimates it is important that any differences, small and
                        large, are discussed and the reasoning behind the differences is understood. Then another round
                        of voting takes place, which leads to the team estimates converging towards a collectively
                        agreed point value. Ultimately, a team can work out how many points they can do in a timebox and
                        can forecast future work throughput, although this does need a degree of stability in the
                        working environment so that like is being compared with like.</p>
                    <h3>12.4.1.2 Further information</h3>
                    <p>There are many variations of numbering systems used and most are based on the Fibonacci sequence
                        of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 etc. Pre-printed playing cards are commonly used with a sequence
                        of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100 or similar, possibly with extra cards too.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, using this points system a requirement estimated at eight points would involve four
                        times the effort compared with a requirement classified as being worth two points.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>Another very popular technique is called ‘T-shirt sizing’. This involves classifying each
                        requirement or user story as being either small (S), medium (M), large (L) or extra-large (XL)
                        and so on. Even a simple rating of ‘high, medium or low’ as a guide to effort can still be
                        effective. These systems are deliberately abstract in that they can be carried out without any
                        relative values or ratios. In effect they just say that a medium task is bigger than a small and
                        not as big as a large.</p>
                    <p>Ratios (or values) can be used with these approaches if desired as shown in Table 12.2. The
                        reason why the numbers increase exponentially, and not in a linear manner, is because there is
                        more uncertainty as the size of a task increases.</p>
                    <h4>12.4.1.3 Hints that may prove useful</h4>
                    <p>When starting the estimation exercise, see if the team can agree on a single base story that
                        represents a value of one (or another number if preferred) so that every other story has
                        something relative to refer to from the start.</p>
                    <p>If a story is estimated at a very large number (e.g. 40 or 100) then it would normally indicate
                        that there is not enough known about the story to provide a realistic estimate. Further
                        investigative work is likely to be required to understand more about the story.</p>
                    <p>Avoid using actual times instead of the points when using this technique. It can cause teams to
                        work less hard or too hard if the estimate is inaccurate, and estimates would need to be based
                        on some form of standard day, which may be difficult to calculate. Points are arbitrary and
                        therefore reduce the likelihood of this problem and the potential for conflict.</p>
                    <p>Do not compare your relative estimates with the relative estimates of other teams. Each team has
                        its own individual way of doing this, and the approach may not be the same across teams (e.g.
                        the degree to which they factor in their own risk appetite might vary).</p>
                    <p>When using playing cards or paper to estimate, do not at any time average out the point scores.
                        It is the debate and interaction between the team members that will result in a greater
                        understanding of the task and therefore produce a more accurate estimate.</p>
                    <p>When considering the relative effort involved it is best not to think of the actual effort
                        required, as this defeats the purpose of the technique. Ultimately these relative estimates can
                        be converted into actual estimates of time and cost if desired but this may not take place (e.g.
                        a delivery team might try and do as much work as possible (measured in points) in the allotted
                        time period). However, in a project context deadlines will need to be forecast so it may be
                        necessary to go some way in converting the relative estimates into times. Please note that when
                        using the more common agile frameworks in the BAU domain, teams are quite happy dealing with
                        relative estimates in the style of points (or similar) and do not convert them to an actual
                        effort figure such as hours or days.</p>
                    <p>The concept of team-based estimation is often referred to as ‘the wisdom of crowds’, and focuses
                        on bringing different areas of knowledge and experience together in order to get the best
                        estimate possible. Unusual estimates from certain team members may contain great insight. One of
                        the benefits of this technique is the amount of communication and understanding that the team
                        generates during this exercise.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The points values are usually referred to as story points as they typically relate to a user story and the amount
                        of effort involved to complete it. Another similar term used for this is ‘complexity points’ where estimates are
                        based on complexity. This is not the same as effort, which already factors in the level of complexity and is
                        illustrated in Figure 12.4.</p>
                    <h2>12.5 PLANS THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>Planning in PRINCE2 operates at several levels and throughout a project. PRINCE2 Agile planning
                        is very comprehensive (e.g. the plans include the requirements/user stories) and when this is
                        carried out in a very collaborative and feature-focused planning style, it creates a lot of
                        knowledge transfer about the plan and the ownership of it.</p>
