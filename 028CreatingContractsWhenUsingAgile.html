                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Many of the fundamental concepts of agile do not sit easily with the way that contracts between a
                        customer and a supplier are typically structured. Agile is a collaboration where a customer and
                        a supplier work together and share risk. A contract is usually an adversarial mechanism which
                        describes ‘legal remedies’ for when things go wrong. Any project using PRINCE2 Agile needs to
                        choose between using existing practices or using a different underlying structure that is more
                        amenable to working in an agile way.</p>
                    <h2>28.1 TRADITIONAL CONTRACTS</h2>
                    <p>In simple terms a typical contract (sometimes referred to as a ‘traditional’ contract) would
                        involve the customer engaging the supplier to deliver a specific solution or output that is
                        defined by a set of specific requirements. These requirements would usually be several in number
                        and may be quite detailed. Along with this there would usually be a deadline and a price.</p>
                    <p>Projects are difficult and face uncertainty; therefore the detailed requirements are likely to
                        change over the course of the project, as well as the understanding of how long the work will
                        take.</p>
                    <p>The principal issue with the traditional structure of a contract is that the requirements and the
                        understanding of the work involved will inevitably change over time, and someone will need to
                        pay for that change, or at least factor this into the contract in the form of a contingency
                        (e.g. the supplier adds 20% to the price).</p>
                    <p>In an agile context this structure is counter-productive because agile is ‘change friendly’ and
                        works on the basis that modifications will inevitably happen; it is not necessarily a negative
                        situation if changes ultimately result in something that is more closely aligned with the
                        customer’s real needs and potentially delivers more value than originally intended.</p>
                    <p>In an agile context the customer and the supplier need to work together to optimize the solution
                        in order to achieve the best possible outcome in terms of value to the customer. Focusing the
                        contract on the solution is less likely to produce this effect.</p>
                    <h2>28.2 PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS WHEN STRUCTURING AN AGILE CONTRACT</h2>
                    <p>When looking to structure a contract in a way that is more conducive to working with agile, the
                        most important area to address first is to understand the level of trust and collaboration
                        between the customer and the supplier. Trust is a difficult area to cover in a contract, as many
                        elements of a contract concern the problems that may occur. Therefore a contract needs to
                        support collaborative ways of working (e.g. by containing incentives and levels of
                        commitment).</p>
                    <p>A customer and supplier may have worked together for several years and the trust and
                        collaboration between them may be very high. Alternatively, if a supplier is new to a customer,
                        levels of trust and collaboration might be unknown and difficult to assess.</p>
                    <p>The reason this is so important is because it will determine the amount of risk that is shared
                        between the customer and the supplier. The risk relates to the uncertainties of the project. A
                        former United States Secretary of Defense used the phrases ‘known unknowns’ and ‘unknown
                        unknowns’ and these exist on any project. When these unknowns surface during a project, who
                        ‘pays’ for the change: the supplier because they should have anticipated it, or the customer
                        because they should have specified it?</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, should the ‘cost’ of the change be shared because both parties know that there is
                        uncertainty and ‘unknowns’? The more trust and collaboration that exist between a customer and
                        supplier, the less is the likelihood of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The supplier adding a contingency premium to the price of the contract in relation to the
                            amount of risk involved
                        </li>
                        <li>The customer going into too much detail when initiating a project in the belief that they
                            are removing uncertainty (sometimes referred to as ‘the illusion of certainty’).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>28.3 GUIDANCE ON HOW TO STRUCTURE AN AGILE CONTRACT</h2>
                    <p>Structuring a contract that is suitable when working with agile does not necessarily involve
                        creating a completely new type of contract. Existing contract frameworks currently being used by
                        organizations may still be suitable to a large extent (e.g. as a master agreement). However,
                        change will be needed at the lower levels in order to work in a more agile way (e.g. in a
                        statement of work (or SOW), which may apply to a period of time, such as a sprint or a
                        release).</p>
                    <p>When using agile, structuring a contract according to the following guidelines is likely to be
                        more beneficial to both parties than using a traditional style of contract:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If possible, make the focus of what is being delivered ‘outcome-based’ in preference to
                            ‘output-based’. An output focus is typically about a product or solution that either is, or
                            is not, as specified. An outcome focus relates to the benefits and value that a project
                            enables. This allows the customer and supplier to work together to create an output (or
                            product) that can be changed and adjusted throughout the course of the project, in order to
                            deliver something more valuable if the opportunity arises. There is a difficulty with
                            outcome-based contracts in that outcomes can be hard to define objectively (see section
                            9.4.1, Defining value) and if this is the case, then a middle ground between outcome and
                            output is to use such things as service levels or throughputs (e.g. velocity), whilst still
                            allowing the customer and supplier to respond to change in order to optimize the value
                            delivered.
                        </li>
                        <li>Define the level of customer involvement needed during the project. This would take the form
                            of how much time would be committed to the project by the customer so that the supplier can
                            benefit from the collaborative working relationship. This is likely to take the form of
                            named individuals from a variety of levels with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
                            When working in an agile way, a collaborative relationship between the customer and supplier
                            is an essential ingredient that helps with many things such as speed of decision-making,
                            accuracy of deliverables and ultimately the ownership of the products delivered. Agreeing
                            the level of commitment in advance and clearly defining responsibilities increase the chance
                            that this collaboration will happen.
                        </li>
                        <li>Create several time-based deliveries as part of the main agreement (e.g. based around
                            sprints or releases), which can be used to monitor the overall project against an agreed
                            baseline that relates to the value the project should deliver. This may, or may not, be put
                            into operational use, but it will show how much is being delivered by the supplier, and it
                            can be measured according to, for example, value, velocity or story points. This allows the
                            customer to see how the project is progressing. In effect the customer is buying amounts of
                            time (or a throughput of work) from the supplier. It may be appropriate to create an initial
                            delivery that goes into more detail of what the project intends to achieve (e.g. this may
                            include requirements-gathering and/or a prototype).
                        </li>
                        <li>Allow for the project to be stopped at any time by the project board. This allows the
                            customer to stop a project if feedback from early deliveries indicates that the project as a
                            whole is no longer viable. This will not be seen by the supplier as breaking an agreement,
                            as this is always a possibility with this form of contract and the supplier is fully aware
                            of it from the start. Further to this, most existing contracts have early termination
                            clauses anyway. This does not preclude the contract from being fixed-price, although the
                            full price will only be relevant if the project runs to completion.
                        </li>
                        <li>Incentives can be linked to the amount delivered. If the supplier delivers everything that was intended
                            during a particular timeframe, then they receive 100% (or even 100%+) of the remuneration agreed.
                            Lesser deliveries could then be on a sliding scale as shown in Table 28.1</li>

                    <p>The composition of an incentive scheme would depend on the level of trust and collaboration

                    <p>An incentive scheme can be seen as a penalty clause depending on the nature of the relationship.
                        If the incentives are linked to throughput (e.g. velocity) this can create a mutually beneficial
                        situation; although trust plays an important part here as throughput can be manipulated (e.g.
                        the supplier inflates the story points used for estimation or delivers more features by focusing
                        on easier, less critical ones – sometimes this is referred to as ‘gaming’). If the incentives
                        are related to outcomes and value delivered, the risk of ‘gaming’ is reduced.</p>

                            detail. If the requirements are not specified in detail from the start, this allows for the
                            correct products to emerge during the course of the project without the need to control and
                            change the baseline created during project initiation, which may form part of the
                            contract.</li>
                        <li>Requirements need to be prioritized so that the most important in terms of value are
                            delivered, and the least important can be used as contingency in order to protect the
                            quality of what is delivered and also to meet deadlines. A minimum viable product (MVP) is
                            also likely to be described. The level of trust is important with respect to the MVP as this
                            may represent a ‘material breach’ and a failure to deliver. Alternatively, it could still be
                            classed as ‘best endeavours’, in that what the customer and supplier set out to achieve did
                            not actually turn out to be possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>Requirements change is handled by ‘trading’ new ones for existing ones (see section 25.5);
                            for example, any new requirements discovered during the project can be added to the
                            requirements list, but the effort needed to satisfy the new requirement will be at the
                            expense of other requirements that are either given a lower place in the order of priorities
                            or removed from the list altogether.
                        </li>
                        <li>Depending on the level of trust between the customer and the supplier, it may be agreeable to
                            create a contract using as few clauses as possible and then add clauses when needed (in
                            effect this represents a ‘minimum viable contract’). This is counter to the usual approach
                            of starting with many clauses and removing the ones that aren’t needed. However, it is the
                            quality of the clauses that is the most important consideration and not the quantity (e.g.
                            specification of who owns the intellectual property of the output).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In summary, the guidelines for structuring a contract for use in an agile context are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus on outcomes or throughput in preference to outputs</li>
                        <li>Define the amount of customer involvement required in order to collaborate with the supplier
                            in the best way
                        </li>
                        <li>Buy amounts of time relating to timeboxes with deliverables</li>
                        <li>Allow for a premature end to the project</li>
                        <li>Relate incentives to the amount delivered (value or throughput)</li>
                    <li>Avoid including detailed requirements</li>
                    <li>Prioritize the requirements and identify an MVP</li>
                    <li>Handle changing requirements by trading out the less important ones</li>
                    <li>If preferred, build a contract up from the ‘minimum’ to start with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>28.4 THE ROLE OF THE SUPPLIER IN AN OUTCOME-BASED CONTRACT</h2>
                    <p>An outcome cannot be achieved by the supplier alone, whereas an output can. This means that the
                        supplier will need to estimate the amount of work they can achieve (e.g. by calculating their
                        expected velocity) and then work with the customer to agree how they commit to this, and how the
                        risk is shared. Typically, the delivery rate is what goes into the contract, as this is under
                        the control of the supplier. It is possible for the outcome or the benefits delivered to go into
                        the contract instead, or as well, but this will depend on how much risk each party wants to
                        share.</p>
                    <h2>28.5 SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>A contract based on outcomes or throughput needs collaboration between the customer and the
                        supplier. In simple terms an agile contract should create the right behaviours; moving from a
                        solution-based view to a view based around throughput or outcomes is more likely to produce
                        those beneficial behaviours. Structuring a contract to align with the agile way of working is
                        advantageous when using PRINCE2 Agile because the customer and supplier should be constantly
                        responding to change in order to deliver the highest value possible in the defined timescale.
                        This therefore needs a contract that supports the objective of delivering value and allowing for
                        change.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the contract should be seen as a safety net and not a weapon.</p>
