                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>All products can exist in a wide range of formats from the very formal (e.g. a bound document) to
                        the very informal (e.g. an email or a conversation). They all need to exist in some form even if
                        only a sentence or a paragraph within another product. It should not be assumed that each
                        product is a document.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 identifies three types of management product (baseline, record and report). They are used
                        by the PRINCE2 processes so that certain roles can take actions and/or make decisions.</p>
                    <p>All of the product descriptions defined by PRINCE2 can be used without any changes: see Appendix
                        A for the full list of PRINCE2 products. The following guidance describes some tailoring and
                        advice that may be appropriate depending on the needs of the project.</p>
                    <h2>23.1 BASELINE PRODUCTS</h2>
                    <p>Baseline products are subject to change control. In Table 23.1, the numbered baseline products
                        refer to the numbers used in the PRINCE2 manual for the PRINCE2 management products (see also
                        Table 16.2).</p>

                                of actual benefits to the customer. The way these are planned will have an impact on the
                                ongoing viability of the project. It would be likely that a significant amount of
                                benefits are planned to be delivered (or at least enabled) before the project end
                                date.</p>

                                this is forecast to be delivered later than expected (see Chapter 9, Business Case
                                theme, for more details).</p>

                                common techniques and concepts that agile uses to communicate (e.g. informal
                                interactions, daily stand-ups, modelling, prototyping, visualization and workshops). See
                                also Chapter 25.</p>
                                <p>This applies to all levels of the project and would define approaches to such things
                                    as how a sprint review will take place and how the delivery teams will communicate
                                    with the project manager through checkpoint reports.</p>

                                versions of products and that change is inevitable; therefore this should be embraced
                                and supported accordingly. In environments where automation and frequent releases into
                                operational use occur, specific tools may exist and their use should be clearly defined.
                                The level at which configuration management takes place needs to take into account that
                                project- or stage-level change may affect the agreed baseline, whereas detailed change
                                is likely not to.</td>

                            <td>Agile plans tend to be informal or low-tech at the delivery level and this can be highly
                                effective even though they may be no more than to-do lists or backlogs. However, there
                                may be more formality as the level of planning goes higher. Release plans may also be
                                created to complement the planning at the stage plan level. Agile plans are likely to
                                show features (or sets of features) and their order and their dependencies, and are
                                likely to have been created collaboratively by those who will carry out the planned
                                work. Product-based planning can still be used at all levels of the project (including
                                product delivery).

                            <td><p>Product descriptions can be used interchangeably with user stories (and sometimes
                                epics). Both product descriptions and user stories can be product backlog items. They
                                describe the ‘who, what and why’. A product description can contain more information
                                than a user story. Product descriptions can be used in tandem with user stories by
                                defining the higher level of understanding with product descriptions and the lower
                                levels of understanding with user stories. The format of a product description could be
                                an index card or a document.</p>

                                <p>The project definition in an agile context is preferably more outcome-based than
                                    solutionbased and is also likely to outline the areas of scope and quality criteria
                                    that have flexibility in the sense that they can be prioritized.</p>
                                <p>The project approach will contain an agile element describing the use of agile, which

                                    the project.</p>

                                although the understanding of the project will now have evolved further.</p>
                                <p>In an agile context the project initiation documentation should be created with the
                                    view of ‘enough and no more’. That is to say it should be complete, but it needs to
                                    be as concise as possible and at the appropriate level of detail. Otherwise its role
                                    as a form of communication will suffer.</p>

                                <p>In alignment with the business case this is likely to focus on defining a product
                                    with a close link to a desired outcome in preference to just defining a solution. It
                                    may be created as part of a workshop (e.g. a visioning workshop). The purpose of
                                    this product should be clearly visible to all irrespective of the project
                                    environment (e.g. it should be clearly displayed on a wall or clearly displayed on

                                <p>It is an important product when combining PRINCE2 with agile in that it defines the
                                    ultimate output (the final product) and the outcome, which needs to be clear and
                                    precise so that the iterative and incremental nature of agile does not go off
                                    track.</p>

                                    similar to epics.</p>

                                the quality level is maintained. Some agile concepts exist in order to protect the level
                                of quality (e.g. by delivering fewer requirements in order to ensure that the quality
                                reviewing is not compromised). Agile behaviours will need to be part of the strategy, as
                                they need to be assured.</p>
                                <p>There may be occasions when the quality level will be set at a low level due to the
                                    uncertainty of the work involved (e.g. the project could be highly innovative). The
                                    audience for this may be ‘early adopters’ who are more interested in utilizing the
                                    product and do not mind some deficiencies in terms of robustness or stability.</p></td>

                                Chapter 24). There is likely to be more focus on the risks associated with the agile
                                behaviours than with other areas of agile because this is where many of the benefits of
                                using agile are found. There may be a significant impact on the project should the
