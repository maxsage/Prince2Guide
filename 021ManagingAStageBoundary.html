                    <h2>21.1 PRINCE2 GUIDANCE ON MANAGING A STAGE BOUNDARY</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Managing a Stage Boundary process is to enable the project board to be provided with
                        sufficient information by the project manager so that it can review the success of the current stage, approve
                        the next stage plan, review the updated project plan, and confirm continued business justification and
                        acceptability of the risks. Therefore, the process should be executed at, or close to the end of, each
                        management stage.</p>
                    <p>Projects do not always go to plan and in response to an exception report (if the stage or project is forecast to
                        exceed its tolerances) the project board may request that the current stage (and possibly the project) is
                        replanned. The output from replanning is an exception plan which is submitted for project board approval in
                        the same way that a stage plan is submitted for approval.</p>
                    <p>The Managing a Stage Boundary process is predicated on dividing the project into management stages.</p>
                    <p>A project, whether large or small, needs to ensure that the products it creates will deliver the benefits being
                        sought, either in their own right or as part of a larger programme. The continuing correct focus of the project
                        should be confirmed at the end of each stage. If necessary, the project can be redirected or stopped to avoid
                        wasting time and money.</p>

                    <p>It is also important to recognize that projects can go wrong or can be affected by external
                        factors that invalidate the business justification. An early identifier of potential failure is
                        the project manager’s forecast that any of the project or stage tolerances are likely to be
                        exceeded. In such cases it is important to have a mechanism for corrective action in order to
                        bring the project back into the right direction.</p>
                    <p>A positive decision not to proceed is not failure. However, providing insufficient information
                        that prevents the project board from making an informed decision is itself a failure as it may
                        lead to a wrong decision.</p>
                    <p>The Managing a Stage Boundary process provides a means by which an exception process can be
                        implemented.</p>
                    <h2>21.2 AGILE WAYS OF WORKING THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST</h2>
                    <p>The Managing a Stage Boundary process is primarily about checking the ongoing viability of a
                        project and stopping the project if this is no longer the case. In agile there is a similar
                        concept of stopping the regular delivery cycle of releases when the value being delivered drops
                        off, becomes marginal to the amount of effort involved or there is an opportunity cost to other
                        work or projects. In agile this is usually determined as and when it happens (e.g. at the end of
                        a sprint or release), whereas in PRINCE2 a stage end and a formal check on ongoing project
                        viability is determined well in advance and the planned delivery of features needs to fit into
                        this.</p>

                            Tip<br> The project board should determine how long a stage should last before deciding what

                            planned, but they should not be driven by this.

                    <p>There is a similarity between a major review of a release (e.g. one that took three months) and the Managing a
                        Stage Boundary process in that progress can be reviewed with respect to how much value or benefit has been
                        delivered, how the team is performing, how the processes are working, and how the project is progressing
                        with regard to quality and product delivery, planning the next release and assessing the project’s exposure to
                        issues and risks.</p>
                    <h2>21.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE ON MANAGING A STAGE BOUNDARY</h2>
                    <p>It is important to use stage boundaries or ‘fire-breaks’ appropriately when working in an agile
                        way as although the delivery teams may be very content, working to a regular cadence and being
                        very productive, because their focus is on product delivery they may not be aware of the wider
                        context of their work. Their work may be going very well but they may not be aware that a
                        competitor has launched a rival product and the expected benefits of the project are now
                        significantly lower. Despite the good efforts of the delivery teams it may be prudent to cancel
                        the project as it is no longer viable.</p>
                    <p>Tailoring guidance that may be appropriate is as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reviewing how much is being delivered (and the quality of it) compared with what had been
                            planned. This would include comparing the amount of value being delivered with the amount of
                            cost incurred to create that value in order to ascertain if the project is still on track
                            and is still viable.
                        </li>
                        <li>What has been released would typically be reviewed. What benefits are being realized?</li>
                        <li>The appropriate use of agile could be reviewed in case risks are surfacing in certain areas
                            (e.g. if the level of customer involvement is lower than expected more formality may be
                            required).
                        </li>
                        <li>Release planning would typically be reviewed. For example, would it be a good idea to
                            increase the frequency of the releases (if it is possible)? Would it be a good idea to alter
                            the number of sprints (or their lengths) inside each release?
                        </li>
                        <li>The efficiency of configuration management and the choice of configuration item records
                            could be assessed with respect to the iterative and incremental nature of the agile way of working. For example, are
                            the configuration item records defined at too low a level and is this causing an unnecessary overhead?
                        </li>

                        <li>Is it worth carrying out a formal workshop to review the stage (perhaps as part of a release
                            review) and then plan the next stage (see Chapter 22, Closing a Project, for how to handle a
                            similar one) or at least a large-scale demo for as many stakeholders as appropriate? (NB: it
                            is unlikely that this event will take place at the very end of a stage – e.g. on the final
                            day.)</li>
                        <li>Decide on which of the suggested improvements to the way the teams are working (perhaps
                            created during a release retrospective) can be reasonably expected to be adopted in the next
                            release. Further learnings could be formalized at this point and given to project support so
                            these lessons can help the wider organization.

                    <h2>21.4 SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>In order to keep a project on track and viable PRINCE2 uses stage boundaries as major control
                        points to assess the current status of the project.</p>
                    <p>Ideally this process should not interrupt the natural flow of a project using agile. Although
                        this is an important point in the project to formalize its continuation, this should still be
                        carried out with as little ceremony as possible because the team interactions and transparency
                        of information will make the situation obvious and therefore the decision easy to make.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the stage the frequent delivery of products in an iterative and incremental style will
                        mean that it will be clear how many features have been delivered and their level of quality.
                        This will give a clearer indication of progress than information relating to time and cost.</p>
                    <p>The continual use of ‘inspect and adapt’ will in turn allow the team to continually and gradually
                        improve how they work with the stage boundary, giving team members the opportunity to
                        consolidate their learnings across the organization as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately this gives the project board the confidence to continue on the current successful path
                        or to stop the project and use its resources elsewhere.</p>
