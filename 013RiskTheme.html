                    <h2>13.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE RISK THEME</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Risk theme is to identify, assess and control uncertainty and, as a result,
                        improve the ability of the project to succeed.</p>
                    <h3>13.1.1 What is a risk?</h3>
                    <p>A risk is an uncertain event or set of events that, should it occur, will have an effect on the
                        achievement of objectives. It consists of a combination of the probability of a perceived threat
                        or opportunity occurring, and the magnitude of its impact on objectives, where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Threat is used to describe an uncertain event that could have a negative impact on
                            objectives
                        </li>
                        <li>Opportunity is used to describe an uncertain event that could have a favourable impact on
                            objectives.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>13.1.2 Risk management procedure</h3>
                    <p>PRINCE2 recommends a risk management procedure comprising the following five steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify (context and risks)</li>
                        <li>Assess (i.e. estimate and evaluate)</li>
                        <li>Plan</li>
                        <li>Implement</li>
                        <li>Communicate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The first four steps are sequential, with the ‘communicate’ step running in parallel because the
                        findings of any of the other steps may need to be communicated prior to the completion of the
                        overall process. All of the steps are iterative in nature in that when additional information
                        becomes available, it is often necessary to re-visit earlier steps and carry them out again to
                        achieve the most effective result. Figure 13.1 shows the elements of the risk management
                        procedure.</p>
                    <h4>13.1.2.1 Identify</h4>
                    <h4>Identify context</h4>
                    <p>The primary goal of the ‘identify context’ step is to obtain information about the project in
                        order to understand the specific objectives that are at risk and to formulate the risk
                        management strategy for the project. The risk management strategy describes how risks will be
                        managed during the project. The project’s risk management strategy should be based on the
                        corporate risk management policy or on the programme’s risk management strategy.</p>
                    <h4>13.1.2.2 Assess</h4>
                    <h4>Estimate</h4>
                    <p>The primary goal of the ‘estimate’ step is to assess the threats and opportunities to the project
                        in terms of their probability and impact.</p>
                    <h4>Evaluate</h4>
                    <p>The primary goal of the ‘evaluate’ step is to assess the net effect of all the identified threats
                        and opportunities on a project when aggregated together.</p>
                    <h4>13.1.2.3 Plan</h4>
                    <p>The primary goal of the ‘plan’ step is to prepare specific management responses to the threats
                        and opportunities identified, ideally to remove or reduce the threats and to maximize the
                        opportunities. Attention to the plan step ensures as far as possible that the project is not
                        taken by surprise if a risk materializes.</p>

                        <img src="images/Figure13-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 13-001 The risk management procedure</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h4>13.1.2.4 Implement</h4>
                    <p>The primary goal of the ‘implement’ step is to ensure that the planned risk responses are
                        actioned, their effectiveness monitored, and corrective action taken where responses do not
                        match expectations.</p>
                    <h4>13.1.2.5 Communicate</h4>
                    <p>Communication is a step that is carried out continually. The ‘communicate’ step should ensure
                        that information related to the threats and opportunities faced by the project is communicated
                        both within the project and externally to stakeholders.</p>
                    <h2>13.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK THEME</h2>
                    <p>In general terms there is relatively less prominence given to the area of risk in agile when
                        compared with other areas such as planning and progress. Issues (often referred to as blockers
                        or impediments) are explicitly addressed (e.g. during a stand-up meeting) but risks and the
                        management of them are handled more implicitly.</p>
                    <p>Agile, by the very nature of some of its concepts, mitigates many risks associated with other
                        approaches (e.g. Waterfall) by preferring the detail to emerge later rather than sooner, and
                        thereby reducing the impact of changes.</p>
                    <p>It could be said that risk management happens due to the responsive and proactive nature of the
                        agile way of working, where the delivery teams are working to short delivery cycles and
                        continually reacting to feedback and looking out for anything that will hinder progress. Further
                        to this, the team approach to being aware of risks means that there is not usually a role
                        accountable for managing it. In a mature agile environment this will exist and it will be clear
                        who manages risk at the project level and at the delivery level.</p>
                    <h2>13.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE FOR THE RISK THEME</h2>
                    <p>The Risk theme in PRINCE2 brings a level of formality to the management of risk, which can be
                        very effective in any agile environment. In many situations it may be possible to manage risk in
                        a real-time way but PRINCE2 puts a lot of emphasis on planned risk management, clearly defining
                        who is accountable for this. In PRINCE2:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is the responsibility of the role that is managing the team (i.e. the team manager) to
                            manage risk at the delivery level, and the responsibility of the role managing the project
                            (i.e. the project manager) to manage risk at the project level.</li>
                        <li>Risk management is formalized and planned, but at a level that is appropriate for the
                            situation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That does not mean to say that the team-based approach to risk management is no longer needed.
                        The opposite is the case in that when using PRINCE2 with agile the whole team should look out
                        for risks and take ownership of risks when appropriate, but ultimately the accountability for
                        managing them lies with the person managing the team and/or managing the project.</p>
                    <h3>13.3.1 Level of formality</h3>
                    <p>Formalizing risk management does not mean creating processes or documents that are bureaucratic.
                        The level of formality should be appropriate to the needs of a project. On some projects, a risk
                        register of a few columns manually updated on a team board may suffice (see Figure 13.2) whereas
                        other projects may require a dozen columns electronically held and accessible remotely.</p>
                    <h3>13.3.2 Addressing risk during stand-up meetings</h3>
                    <p>Due to the implicit nature of risk management in some forms of agile, it is good practice to
                        ensure that the delivery teams understand the difference between something that ‘has happened’
                        or ‘is happening’ (referred to as an ‘issue’ in PRINCE2) versus something that ‘may happen’
                        (referred to as a ‘risk’ in PRINCE2).</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure13-002.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 13-002 An informal risk register may be appropriate in certain situations</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This is particularly relevant in stand-up meetings (or daily Scrums – see Appendix H). When
                        asking team members if anything is blocking their progress (sometimes called an ‘impediment’),
                        it is good practice to also ask if they are aware of anything that ‘may potentially’ block their
                        progress. This does not necessarily need to be a separate question but the distinction is
                        important, as the two questions require different responses.</p>
                    <p>When dealing with projects and difficult situations it is essential to actively manage risk.
                        PRINCE2 sees this as essential in all situations. It is not optional.</p>
                    <h3>13.3.3 Agile risks</h3>
                    <p>Much of the agile way of working has been created to address the many risks associated with
                        Waterfall projects – for example, avoiding detailed specifications at the early stages because
                        the details may change, or delivering early and often to highlight misunderstandings. Although
                        the agile way of working may reduce many common risks (which is one of the reasons for its
                        growth in popularity) it does have risk areas of its own, such as:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Agile relies on customer involvement, so what happens if the customer lacks commitment or is
                            not empowered to make decisions?
                        </li>
                        <li>Agile relies on people interacting quickly and effectively, so what happens if a team is
                            split over more than one site and in different time zones?
                        </li>
                        <li>Agile benefits from iterative and incremental delivery of products, so what happens if this
                            is difficult to do due to the limitations of the existing infrastructure or legislation?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Another risk that should not be overlooked when working in an agile way is that value is
                        delivered before it has been planned. Although this may be a positive situation and will not
                        happen as a surprise (due to frequent customer involvement), it is still a risk and needs to be
                        managed accordingly (e.g. end-users need training earlier or benefits that are delivered earlier
                        can be applied to other projects).</p>
                    <p>A PRINCE2 project using agile will face many risks faced by any project but it is vulnerable to
                        specific agile risks and these need to be managed. PRINCE2 Agile contains an agile risk
                        assessment tool called the Agilometer and this is described in Chapter 24.</p>
                    <h2>13.4 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                    <p>Some of the concepts and techniques relevant to managing risk are described in Table 13.1.</p>
                    <h2>13.5 RISK THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>PRINCE2 places focus on the Risk theme, and with its alignment to Management of Risk (M_o_R) it
                        brings a wide body of knowledge to this area offering many benefits to the agile way of working,
                        such as with planning a risk strategy and managing risks throughout the project.</p>
                    <p>When using PRINCE2 Agile it is important to ensure that the behaviours, concepts, frameworks and
                        techniques of agile are correctly in place as many elements of the agile way of working manage
                        and mitigate risk by their very nature – for example, concepts such as working iteratively and
                        incrementally, and techniques that help to prioritize the work.</p>
                    <p>The most important areas that help with managing risk in an agile context are the five behaviours
                        in PRINCE2 Agile of transparency, collaboration, rich communication, self-organization and
                        exploration (see section 7.4). If these are then complemented by appropriate planning and
                        ongoing risk management (see section 13.1), it greatly increases the chances of completing a
                        successful project.</p>

                                risk accurately (selecting the correct responses to threats and opportunities created by
                                uncertainty) and thereby improve service delivery.

                                days lost. This then creates a value for the days that may be lost from a timebox. When
                                this is accumulated for all risks associated with a timebox, a total exposure (in
                                potential days lost) can be calculated. This is shown graphically in the form of a
                                burn-down chart that can be addressed (i.e. burnt down) by mitigating or addressing the
