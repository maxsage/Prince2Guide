                    <p>The purpose of this focus area is to describe how to define and prioritize requirements (or user stories), so
                        that they are in a form that is conducive to working in an agile way (where the requirements are subject to
                        the inevitability of change – see also Chapter 14, Change theme).</p>
                    <h3>25.1.1 Requirements terminology</h3>
                    <p>There are many terms that are used to describe what a product does or how well it does it. In
                        PRINCE2 Agile the conventions in Table 25.1 are used.</p>

                    <h4>25.1.1.1 Further clarification</h4>
                    <p>The following lists some of the ways requirements are treated in PRINCE2 Agile:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order to meet a requirement or produce a product it may be necessary to carry out one or
                            more ‘tasks’. These could appear on a team plan or sprint backlog (not referred to as
                            requirements by PRINCE2 Agile).
                        </li>
                        <li>Requirements fall into two types: functional (what it does) and non-functional (how well it
                            does it).
                        </li>
                        <li>Throughout the PRINCE2 and the agile communities, many of these terms are used
                            interchangeably (e.g. function, feature, user story, requirement) although they are not
                            necessarily referring to the same thing. Table 25.1 provides the view of PRINCE2 Agile and
                            how it refers to these terms.
                        </li>
                        <li>Throughout this manual, the terms ‘requirements’, ‘product descriptions’ and ‘user stories’
                            are often used interchangeably, as most of the time they are referring to the same thing.
                            The choice of term will depend on which term best suits the context.
                        </li></ul>
                    <h3>25.1.2 The role of requirements</h3>
                    <p>Requirements have a special role in an agile context. They represent the ‘currency’ an agile team
                        deals in. Managing and trading requirements becomes a focal point of the way an agile team
                        works, as less focus needs to be applied to other constraints such as managing time and
                        cost.</p>
                    <p>Defining a requirement is one thing, defining it well is another! It is essential that
                        requirements are defined well, as this gives a level of precision that actually defines the end
                        product. However, to do this requires the relevant technical skills and the use of good
                        techniques such as interviewing skills and process modelling.</p>
                    <p>Take, as an example of the importance of requirements, the delivery of a new kitchen. This is
                        what the customer wants and what the project must deliver, as described in the project product
                        description. A business case would have been created in order to justify this. But how does the
                        customer define what they mean by ‘a kitchen’? Does the new kitchen have a dishwasher and an
                        ice-maker? How important are these features? Requirements describe what the customer means by ‘a
                        kitchen’</p>
                    <h2>25.2 REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION</h2>
                    <p>One of the most powerful techniques in PRINCE2 is that of product-based planning (see Appendix
                        D). This technique shifts the emphasis from activity-based planning to a more black-and-white
                        form of planning focused on the end state of a product or sub-product (i.e. is it complete and
                        100% finished, or is it still a work in progress?) agile works in the same way as with the
                        definition of ‘done’ in Scrum (see Appendix H) and ‘acceptance criteria’ in the glossary.</p>
                    <h2>25.3 DEFINING PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
                    <p>It is important when using PRINCE2 with agile to define product descriptions at the correct level
                        of detail at the right time and then allow them to evolve. Too much detail will stifle the
                        dynamic and responsive nature of agile because agile refines the detailed understanding of a
                        product as it evolves. Equally, too little detail creates room for misunderstanding, as
                        requirements would be too vague. This would then need further clarification or rework, causing
                        delays and probably frustration.</p>
                    <h2>25.4 REQUIREMENTS DECOMPOSITION AND GRANULARITY</h2>
                    <p>Essential to the success of using PRINCE2 with agile is to ensure that requirements are defined
                        at the appropriate level of understanding during each stage of a project. This normally involves
                        a simple three-step process (see Table 25.2 and Figure 25.1), although this may be done in two
                        steps on smaller projects where the processes of Starting up a Project and Initiating a Project
                        may have been combined</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure25-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 25-001 Possible requirements decomposition and equivalent terminology</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This could be likened to JIT (just-in-time) inventory management in that just enough detail needs
                        to be available at the right time. The ‘Level of requirement’ column in Table 25.2 is only a
                        very general guide and is included to give at least some idea of scale, but this should not be
                        seen as anything more than a rudimentary rule of thumb. If a team is prioritizing 200 user
                        stories it should not be in the pre-project stage!</p>
                    <p>The ‘Metaphor’ column is intended to provide help with visualizing the need to take requirements
                        and break them down through the duration of the project. Too much detail early on can obscure
                        the bigger picture.</p>

                    <p>From an estimation point of view (in the form of time, cost or benefits), the margin of error at
                        each of these stages could be as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-project, 50% to 100%</li>
                        <li>Initiating stage, 20% to 40%</li>
                        <li>Delivery stage(s), 10% to 20%.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Again, this should only be seen as a guide and for illustrative purposes as this will vary
                        according to such things as industry sector, organization and experience. It is sometimes
                        referred to as the ‘cone of uncertainty’. The real margin of error will vary from project to
                        project depending on each project’s conditions and level of uncertainty.

                    <h2>25.5 REQUIREMENTS PRIORITIZATION</h2>
                    <p>Requirements prioritization is an essential part of using PRINCE2 in an agile environment and is
                        at the heart of how it works. Continual prioritization of what is being delivered and the work
                        being done enables deadlines to be hit and the quality level to be protected.</p>
                    <h3>25.5.1 Approaches to prioritization</h3>
                    <p>With respect to product delivery, there are two approaches to prioritization that are frequently
                        used when working in an agile way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MoSCoW</li>
                        <li>Ordering (1,2,3,…,n).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is important to use the correct approach in the correct situation because these do not work in
                        the same way. MoSCoW typically works at higher levels and over longer timescales where
                        requirements may be grouped by function and dependencies exist between these functions.</p>
                    <p>Ordering primarily works at a lower level (or task level) where certain technical activities are
                        taking place.</p>
                    <p>The choice of approach will be dictated by the level of uncertainty of the work being undertaken.
                        Generally speaking MoSCoW would be the default approach, as it specifically addresses situations
                        where work is time-bound and finite such as when working on a project, or in a timebox.</p>
                    <h3>25.5.2 Definition of MoSCoW</h3>
                    <p>This acronym is used to categorize items such as requirements or tasks into one of the four
                        following levels of how they relate to a deadline (see Table 25.3):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must have</li>
                        <li>Should have</li>
                        <li>Could have</li>
                        <li>Won’t have for now.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It is a very natural and common concern that, when prioritizing using MoSCoW, everything will
                        turn out to be a ‘must’. Typically, this is rarely true.</p>

                    <h3>25.5.4 Is the requirement essential?</h3>
                    <p>One technique for checking if a requirement really is a ‘must’ is to ask the question: ‘Would you
                        put the product into operational use without this?’ In other words, is the output from the
                        project still viable in accordance with the rationale and justification for the project, without
                        satisfying this requirement?</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Would you sell a car without wheels or an engine?</li>
                        <li>Would you sell a car without satellite navigation?</li>
                        <li>Would you sell a car without electric windows?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although the example is a simplistic analogy, it highlights that some features of a car are
                        essential and others are not. Also, those features that are not essential may have satisfactory
                        alternatives such as a manual winder for the windows.</p>
                    <p>Further to this, the analogy also highlights the need to understand the overall objective for the
                        project (as defined in the project product description), as the MoSCoW priorities would be
                        different if the objective was to produce a luxury car as opposed to a budget car.</p>
                    <h3>25.5.5 Can the requirement be decomposed?</h3>
                    <p>Another technique which can be used to reduce the amount of effort needed for the ‘musts’ is to
                        break the requirement down into more detail. It is normal for a high-level requirement that has
                        been prioritized as a ‘must’ to be broken down into sub-requirements that comprise several
                        musts, shoulds and coulds, thereby creating contingency in the form of shoulds and coulds.</p>
                    <p>Take, for example, the search function of a customer relationship management system that must be
                        able to search for customer details. The sub-requirements or musts, shoulds and coulds of such a
                        function include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must be able to search by customer name</li>
                        <li>Could be able to search on parts of the customer name</li>
                        <li>Must be able to search by customer account number</li>
                        <li>Should be able to search by address</li>
                        <li>Could be able to search by date of birth.</li>

                            Tip<br> If ever you need to quickly demonstrate prioritization with MoSCoW, a simple ballpoint pen
                            can be a useful prop (see Figure 25.2). It can also be used to illustrate decomposition
                            and how a ‘must’ can exist within a ‘could’.

                    <h3>25.5.6 Ordering</h3>
                    <p>There are situations when the best way to prioritize is to use a simple list where the most
                        important item is at the top and the least important is at the bottom. This could be achieved
                        using a basic scoring system from 1 to 5 for each item in the list, and then ordering all the 5s
                        relative to one another and then so on with the 4s and 3s etc. This approach to prioritization
                        is most appropriate when there is little dependency among the items on the list (i.e. they are
                        broadly independent of one another) and the items on the list do not naturally group together so
                        that they can be worked on at the same time.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Kanban and Scrum tend to use ordering rather than MoSCoW. However, this approach may not work as
                        well as MoSCoW if a list of requirements has natural groupings and/or dependencies, as the
                        following example shows.</p>
                    <h4>25.5.6.1 Example</h4>
                    <p>You are building a luxury house that must be finished by a certain date. You cannot lower the
                        level of quality and you cannot use additional resources to get it finished on time.</p>
                    <p>The best prioritization approach to use in this situation is MoSCoW, as you would plan a series
                        of high-level deliverables based around activities that can be grouped together and dependencies
                        that need to be met. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear the site, lay the foundations and install services (e.g. electricity and water).</li>
                        <li>Build the main house (so that you can live somewhere).</li>
                        <li>Build the garage.</li>
                        <li>Create the garden (after most of the construction vehicles have left).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You may feel that the most important part of the whole project is the roof on the main house, but
                        you wouldn’t start with this. You may also feel that the garden is more important to you than
                        the garage, but you would deliver this after the garage because the process of building the
                        garage may ruin the garden. When using MoSCoW, you do not necessarily deliver all of the ‘musts’
                        first. In cases where you have many features that are dependent on each other, this will rarely
                        happen.</p>
                    <p>If your plan for the garden involves creating several features – such as a pond, a patio,
                        planting trees, creating flowerbeds, building a greenhouse, creating a sandpit and installing a
                        bird table – then this part of the project may lend itself more to ordering than MoSCoW because
                        the features are reasonably independent of each other and do not naturally group together. You
                        would then complete as many of these as you could before the deadline.</p>
                    <h3>25.5.7 What can be prioritized?</h3>
                    <p>When using agile, prioritization is used constantly and in many forms. The most obvious area
                        where prioritization happens is with respect to the requirements of the project, and this covers
                        those that are both functional and non-functional. Using a camera as an example, its functional
                        and non-functional requirements could include that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It MUST take a photograph (functional).</li>
                        <li>Its shutter MUST work in cold temperatures (non-functional).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Many other areas could be prioritized, such as the tasks that need to be completed to satisfy a
                        requirement. One especially useful area that could be prioritized is the quality criteria
                        relating to a particular requirement or product description. Following on from the example
                        above:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The shutter MUST work at –5°C</li>
                        <li>The shutter SHOULD work at –20°C</li>
                        <li>The shutter COULD work at –35°C.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Quality review activities could also be prioritized in order to target testing and checking more
                        effectively, as it is rare that there is enough time to check everything.</p>
                    <p>It is important that the correct prioritization approach is used in the appropriate circumstance.
                        This is affected by the level of the requirements and their dependency on one another.</p>
                    <h3>25.5.8 Handling change with prioritization</h3>
                    <p>Change is inevitable on any project and PRINCE2 Agile refers to two types of change: detail and
                        baseline (see also Chapter 14, Change theme).</p>
                    <h4>25.5.8.1 Detail change</h4>
                    <p>If the customer changes their mind on a requirement or comes up with a new requirement but this
                        does not affect the project product description, then this would be seen as creating a more
                        accurate final product and therefore would be seen as something positive.</p>
                    <h4>25.5.8.2 Baseline change</h4>
                    <p>If on the other hand a change to a requirement, or a new requirement, means that there needs to
                        be a change to a product description, then this would be seen as a change to the baseline of the
                        project and would therefore mean the rationale and justification of the project would need to be
                        revisited.</p>
                    <p>A problem often cited on projects is that of ‘scope creep’. PRINCE2 does not see refining the
                        detailed requirements as they evolve as scope creep, whereas if there are changes to the
                        higher-level requirements then this needs the appropriate level of governance. The tolerances
                        used to define requirements can help with this along with defining the quality criteria more as
                        a spectrum, rather than a binary condition.</p>
                    <h3>25.5.9 Dynamic change with prioritization</h3>
                    <p>PRINCE2 Agile is structured around flexing what is delivered as outlined in Chapter 6. Due to
                        this, change can be handled very dynamically, if the change is of the detailed type outlined
                        previously. When change of this type occurs there are two questions that need to be answered
                        with respect to prioritization:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the priority of the new requirement?</li>
                        <li>Which requirement, or requirements, will be de-scoped to make way for the new requirement?
                            This is sometimes referred to as ‘trading’, or ‘swapping’, requirements.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although answering these questions may involve discussions with various stakeholders including
                        representatives of the supplier side, ultimately it needs to be driven from the customer
                        side.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Hints that may prove useful:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>See the list of requirements as dynamic – embrace change at the detailed level.</li>
                        <li>Remember ‘Archimedes’ law of displacement’ – it also applies to new requirements or tasks:
                            if new ones are coming in then some of the existing ones need to make way. This will be
                            carried out by removing requirements or tasks that are of a similar level of effort.
                        </li>
                        <li>One of the first reactions to a delay, or an issue, of a project manager using agile in a
                            PRINCE2 environment should be to think ‘I need the customer to de-scope something or at
                            least flex the quality criteria on something.’
                        </li>
                        <li>Are the tolerance levels flexible enough to allow for a reasonable amount of de-scoping or
                            flexing of the quality criteria, or are they too narrow and causing off-specs and requests
                            for change?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>25.5.10 The reason for prioritization</h3>
                    <p>Prioritizing requirements or user stories is a regular and fundamental activity when using agile,
                        but the reasons for this are sometimes overlooked. If you are prioritizing and in effect
                        ‘maximizing the amount of work you are not doing’ then you will be able to hit deadlines,
                        protect the quality of the products being delivered and respond to changes in order to provide a
                        more accurate final product.</p>
                    <h2>25.6 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                    <h3>25.6.1 User stories</h3>
                    <p>User stories are a very popular technique used throughout agile. The thinking behind user stories
                        is quite simple and if some basic guidelines are followed correctly their use can be quite
                        effective. This simplicity only goes so far and user stories need to be complemented by a degree
                        of rigour to gain the most benefit from this technique.</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.1 The basics</h4>
                    <p>The exact format can vary but will be based on describing ‘who, what and why?’</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.2 As a
                        &lt;role&gt;, I want to
                            &lt;function&gt;, so that
                                &lt;benefit&gt;
                    </h4>
                    <p>Originally the above heading would have been physically written on a card or sticky note (see
                        Figure 25.3 for an example of a well-written user story) but capturing this electronically (e.g.
                        on a spreadsheet) now also takes place. However, there is more visibility and transparency if it
                        is hand written (or printed off) and this is the preferred approach if possible.</p>
                    <p>Additional information is needed to evolve the user story – one important area being the addition
                        of acceptance criteria (in the same way as with quality criteria for a PRINCE2 product
                        description) in order to be able to test the user story. Sometimes this is called acceptance
                        criteria or the definition of ‘done’. Further to this the user story should also contain at some
                        point an idea of the effort involved in creating it and an idea of the value that it is worth to
                        the customer. These two values could be relative or actual (see section 12.4.1).</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 sees user stories as broadly similar to a requirement (which may be a product description
                        or contained within a product description (see section 25.1.1 for information on how to map
                        these terms). A user story does have its own style in that it is often low-tech (i.e. it is very
                        simple in form) and is often a physical thing (such as an index card).</p>
                    <p>It is essential to avoid the common mistake made when using user stories, which is to see them
                        for more than what they are. They are not fully or partially defined requirements: they are a
                        starting point.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of a user story is to enable discussion and communication to take place in order to
                        arrive at a thorough understanding of what the customer needs. The card provides interesting
                        information but it is the conversation around it that is vital. Mike Cohn (verbal communication)
                        describes it as ‘a token for a conversation’.</p>
                    <p>Further to this point it could be argued that the information on a user story is deliberately
                        insufficient in order to necessitate a conversation with the customer.</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.3 Further information</h4>
                    <p>The ‘Three Cs’ technique (created by Ron Jeffries) distils this into three steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Card Writing the story card</li>
                        <li>Conversation The ongoing discussion involving the card</li>
                        <li>Confirmation Writing the acceptance test.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The INVEST mnemonic (created by Bill Wake) is used by many as a simple checklist to create a
                        well-written user story in that it should be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I – Independent</li>
                        <li>N – Negotiable</li>
                        <li>V – Valuable</li>
                        <li>E – Estimable</li>
                        <li>S – Small</li>
                        <li>T – Testable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In terms of managing the user stories (e.g. for planning purposes), making each user story
                        ‘independent’ from one another means that someone can work on that user story without
                        overlapping with or being dependent on someone else’s work. Making them ‘small’ further helps
                        with planning and the quicker delivery of value.</p>
                    <p>‘Negotiable’ refers to the collaborative working between the customer and the team delivering the
                        product.</p>
                    <p>The thinking behind making the user story ‘valuable’, ‘estimable’ and ‘testable’ focuses the
                        customer and the team to be clear on what they are really trying to achieve. If these three
                        cannot be achieved then there is more to do before work commences.</p>
                    <p>The SMART abbreviation can also be used in this way (i.e. Specific, Measurable, Agreed,
                        Realistic, Timed).</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.4 Epics</h4>
                    <p>Embryonic customer requirements can initially be quite large or vague. This has given rise to a
                        different type of user story known as an epic. In effect this is a high-level or ‘super-user’
                        story that will over time be broken down into user stories at a level of granularity that the
                        delivery teams can work on. One approach to deriving the user stories is to walk through the
                        process which relates to the epic.</p>
                    <p>Epics can appear on a product backlog but they would not appear towards the top, as they would
                        not be written in sufficient detail.</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.5 Hints that may prove useful</h4>
                    <p>User stories should be seen as summarizing key information about a requirement. Therefore it
                        would usually be the case that other supporting information or documentation would need to be
                        referenced in order to fully understand all of the detail behind a user story. This supporting
                        information could have many forms such as a more detailed written specification, figures and
                        models or reference material such as standards and guidelines. These cross-references would be
                        included as part of the user story.</p>
                    <p>People sometimes refer to epics as coarse-grained user stories that break down into fine-grained
                        user stories.</p>
                    <p>If the user story clearly shows the information regarding effort and value, it can make
                        prioritization easier. A high-value feature with a low amount of effort will stand out as a
                        priority.</p>
                    <p>User stories evolve as understanding increases. This is why in an agile environment there is
                        little desire to define them in detail in the early stages of a project.</p>
                    <p>Acceptance criteria are often harder to write than they may first appear. One approach is to
                        frame the acceptance criteria in the form of user-focused questions. For example, if you are
                        setting acceptance criteria for a coffee mug, the following may be appropriate:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote-footer mb-0 font-italic">Can I put boiling-hot water into the mug and drink from it within five minutes by holding the mug
                        by the handle?</blockquote>
                    <p>Just specifying the criterion that ‘it will need to hold boiling-hot water’ doesn’t help with
                        what the user actually wants to do (as the handle may be too hot to touch). Equally, specifying
                        a thickness measurement in respect of the width of the mug (e.g. 2 mm) still doesn’t relate
                        directly to the user’s need.</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.6 Creating user stories requires some skill</h4>
                    <p>Creating user stories is often a lot harder than it appears. Creating good user stories and
                        requirements are skills that can take a long time to master. Specialist roles such as
                        requirements engineers and business analysts can add a lot of value in this area.</p>
                    <p>On projects that normally require more than one customer representative, the need for technical
                        specialization in the area of writing user stories and requirements may become necessary.</p>
                    <p>It is one thing to write a user story, but another thing altogether to write a good one (see
                        Figure 25.3).</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure25-003.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 25-003 A good user story and a poor one</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h4>25.6.1.7 Definition of ‘ready’</h4>
                    <p>Although not as common as using the definition of ‘done’ or using acceptance criteria, the use of
                        the definition of ‘ready’ is a practice used by many in the agile community. This is, in effect,
                        the opposite of ‘Are we done?’, as it means ‘Are we ready?’ For example, a definition of ‘ready’
                        could be created for a user story so that a delivery team knows that it can start working on
                        it.</p>
                    <p>For example, in order for a user story (in this case prior to sizing/estimation) to be considered
                        ‘ready’, it must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contain all three fields describing the who, what and why</li>
                        <li>Be understood by the delivery team</li>
                        <li>Have a benefit that is measurable</li>
                        <li>Have a function that does not contain a solution</li>
                        <li>Adhere to the INVEST guidelines</li>
                        <li>Have acceptance criteria that are understood by the team</li>
                        <li>Define the user as a role</li>
                        <li>Identify any supporting documents that are relevant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>25.6.1.8 Technical stories</h4>
                    <p>User stories, as the name implies, focus on the people and roles that interact with the product.
                        This works well when we are describing what something does and what function it needs to
                        perform. However, it doesn’t work so well when we are describing how the product works in terms
                        of such things as performance or speed. Further to this, when a customer is describing how the
                        product needs to work, this often applies to many features. In other words this kind of
                        requirement can cut across several user stories.</p>
                    <p>These kinds of requirements are often described as ‘non-functional’ and they need to be handled
                        carefully when working in an agile environment. Fitting them into the standard user story format
                        is possible (e.g. refer to the ‘user’ as ‘the system’) but treating them slightly differently
                        and referring to them as technical stories is also an option.</p>
                    <p>An example of a technical story may be when work needs to be completed on the underlying quality
                        of the product (often called refactoring in agile) or experiments and investigations need to
                        take place (often called prototyping or spiking in agile). Sometimes this kind of story or
                        requirement can be included in the definition of ‘done’, but these types of story are still
                        important as normal user stories though they may be captured in a slightly different way.</p>
                    <h4>25.6.1.9 A means to an end</h4>
                    <p>User stories are an effective technique when using agile. They are easy to manage, they stimulate
                        collaboration and ultimately, when used correctly, improve communication. But always remember it
                        is what happens around the user story that is far more important than the user story itself.</p>
