                    <h2>8.1 THE PRINCE2 THEMES</h2>
                    <p>PRINCE2 identifies seven integrated themes that are always present throughout a project.</p>
                    <p>The PRINCE2 themes are those aspects of project management that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Need to be addressed continually. They are not one-off activities. For example, risk
                            management should be central to every decision: it is not a case of updating a register from
                            time to time.
                        </li>
                        <li>Require specific treatment for the PRINCE2 processes to be integrated effectively. For
                            example, the processes require a division of responsibilities between those people who
                            direct (the project board), those who manage (the project manager) and those who deliver
                            (the project [delivery] team) as defined in the Organization theme.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The themes provide guidance on how the process activities should be performed (and explain why).
                        For example, numerous processes in PRINCE2 involve creating or approving plans: explanatory
                        guidance can be found in the Plans theme, which is covered in Chapter 12 of this guide.</p>
                    <p>How PRINCE2 Agile is tailored for the PRINCE2 themes is described in Table 8.1.</p>
                    <h2>8.2 SOME THEMES ARE MORE PROMINENT THAN OTHERS</h2>
                    <p>Because most agile guidance is focused on product delivery, some of the themes are very prominent
                        when combining agile with PRINCE2 (e.g. the Plans theme and the Progress theme), whereas others
                        are less prominent (e.g. the Business Case theme and the Risk theme). However, all of the themes
                        still need to be used, as they are equally important.</p>

                    <h2>8.3 SUMMARY OF TAILORING GUIDANCE FOR THE PRINCE2 THEMES</h2>
                    <p>PRINCE2 uses themes to describe aspects of project management that must be addressed continually.
                        It is essential to use all of the seven themes. Table 8.1 provides a summary of guidance where
                        particular areas of understanding may be required for each theme.</p>

                                possibly emphasis) on the tolerances around benefits with respect to priorities,
                                timescales and the amount of product being delivered. This business case could show the
                                amount of product being delivered in the form of a best-case, a worst-case and an
                                expected-case scenario in relation to the amount of the final product that may be
                                delivered or flexed.<br> It may be appropriate to explicitly define what would
                                constitute a minimum viable product (MVP), as well as some indication of priorities
                                within the overall scope and related quality criteria.<br> When creating a business
                                case, understanding is required of how the incremental delivery of a product and the
                                value associated with it could impact project viability (positively or negatively) and
                                also the ability to achieve the early delivery of some benefits.<br> Where there is a
                                high level of uncertainty the business case should be developed very quickly and the
                                assumptions tested rapidly. This approach could be described as ‘taking a leap of
                                faith’.

                                delivery-level roles may need to be added, and the most common agile roles should be
                                mapped appropriately to the roles of the project management team structure.<br>
                            Understanding is required of:<br> <ul>
                                    <li>How a self-organizing delivery team operates and how this relates to the team

                                    <li>The responsibilities of the most common agile roles such as product owner, Scrum
                                        master, agile coach, business ambassador
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The potential limitations of the product owner role, where a wider view of the
                                        customer is needed – such as with multi-team projects
                                    </li>
                                    <li>How the senior user role acts more as a ‘super product owner’ than a
                                        conventional product owner
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Where more than one team is involved, how Scrum masters will liaise with the
                                        project manager.
                                    </li>

                                The full and uncompromised use of management by exception
                            is essential to enable PRINCE2 and agile to be combined, in order to empower the project
                            management team and enable it to selforganize within clearly defined boundaries.

                            <td>It is important to understand the difference between scope and quality when defining
                                customer quality expectations, acceptance criteria, product descriptions, quality
                                criteria and quality tolerances. They need to be defined in such a way that flexing what
                                is being delivered does not compromise the fitness for purpose of any product, or
                                ultimately the final product. Further to this, carefully differentiating functional from
                                non-functional requirements is important, as this can help with respect to
                                prioritization.<br>
                                The use of agile concepts and techniques such as the definition of
                                ‘done’ and the definition of ‘ready’ can be used to define quality criteria and
                                acceptance criteria.<br>
                                The frequency of quality checking (in the form of reviews or tests)
                                will have a significant impact on how a project is planned, as this will affect the
                                iterative and incremental delivery of the project’s products and how they are released.

                            <td>Although no changes are required with this theme, many agile techniques and approaches
                                exist in this area. They focus on the effort related to features (e.g. sprint planning)
                                and often appear in an informal, low-tech, visible format such as a simple list or
                                backlog. Planning is often done empirically.<br>
                                Agile typically looks at how much can be
                                produced in a fixed timeframe such as a sprint or a release (or how much value can be
                                delivered). This is often shown at the start in the form of a burn chart that can then
                                be tracked.<br>
                                This is in contrast to creating milestones representing how long something
                                will take and showing this on a Gantt chart, as this is of limited value. Gantt charts
                                may be of value at the higher levels of plan but they should be synchronized to the
                                agile way of working and should avoid the duplication of information that is being held
                                in the form of backlogs.

                            <td>Risk</td>
                            <td>The agile way of working addresses many risk areas such as avoiding too much detail at
                                the start of a project (as it will not be fully understood at this point) but it comes
                                with its own set of potential risks and these need to be proactively managed (e.g.
                                ensuring that customer engagement is continual and that customer representatives are
                                correctly empowered).<br>
                                Many agile techniques address risks, for example daily stand-up
                                meetings, frequent delivery of products, frequent use reviews, customer interaction and
                                empowered teams organizing themselves to deliver the right thing at the right time.

                                and responds to it. The PRINCE2 approach to change control needs to allow for this and
                                helps to create a more accurate final product.<br>
                                The appropriate definition of product
                                descriptions, quality criteria, quality tolerances and work packages is important. They
                                can be defined in such a way as to allow for change, whilst at the same time creating a
                                clearly defined baseline that can prevent a change to the very purpose of a product
                                going undetected.<br>
                                A change authority may still be appropriate but is unlikely to
                                function at the delivery level unless it carries out its duties informally, and the
                                change authority needs to understand how detailed change is perceived and addressed in
                                agile.<br>
                                A change budget is unlikely to exist, as the agile way of working uses the
                                prioritization of what is being delivered as contingency.<br>
                                Configuration management will
                                need to be set up in a way that also helps to embrace change, as it may happen
                                frequently.

                                emphasis is on tracking what is being delivered in the form of such things as velocity,
                                lead times or value. This is as opposed to tracking time and cost, which are not
                                suitable as a measure of a project’s progress. Tolerances would be set in accordance
                                with this.<br>
                                Tracking progress will depend on the situation and what people need
                                information on. If it is within a sprint then burn-up or burn-down charts may suffice
                                (see section 15.4.1). If it is across releases, then showing the value accrued and how
                                this relates to the business case may be more appropriate.<br>
                                The frequent delivery of
                                products that meet the appropriate acceptance criteria/quality criteria is the primary
                                source of information with respect to progress and provides the basis for forecasting
                                future progress.

                            Tip<br> Planning poker is a technique used to estimate effort or the relative size of development
                            goals. Each member of the development group selects one card from a set of numbered
                            cards and places it face down on a table. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are
                            then discussed.

                            Definition: Velocity<br>
                            A description of the rate of progress a team is making. For example, if a team is completing
                            20 user stories per week, then this is their velocity and it can be used to empirically
                            forecast their future rate of progress (assuming that the conditions remain the same).
