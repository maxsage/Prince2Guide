                    <p>This appendix contains checklists that can be used at any time during a project to assess how well the project
                        is going from an agile perspective. This is not a replacement for the PRINCE2 health check, which should be
                        used as well.</p>
                    <p>A positive response to any of the following statements would usually indicate that agile is
                        working well in that respect. Each answer in isolation means relatively little but, in totality,
                        the health check will give a general indication of the health of the project in agile terms. A
                        simple rating system of ‘yes or no’ should be sufficient, but this can be elaborated further if
                        desired.</p>
