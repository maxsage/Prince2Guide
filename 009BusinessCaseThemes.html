                    <h2>9.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE BUSINESS CASE THEME</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Business Case theme is to establish mechanisms to judge whether the project is
                        (and remains) desirable, viable and achievable as a means to support decision-making in its
                        (continued) investment. It is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must have continued business
                        justification.</p>
                    <p>In PRINCE2, the business case is developed at the beginning of the project and maintained
                        throughout the life of the project, being formally verified by the project board at each key
                        decision point, such as end stage assessments, and confirmed throughout the period that the
                        benefits accrue (see Figure 9.1).</p>
                    <p>The business case should describe the reasons for the project based on estimated costs, risks and
                        expected benefits. See section A.2 for the typical contents of a business case.</p>
                    <h2>9.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS CASE THEME</h2>
                    <p>In a mature agile environment a business case would be created in some form. As part of the
                        vision and product roadmap there would be sufficient information to ensure that the work is
                        appropriately justified and that it is strategically aligned. This would need to take place
                        before release planning takes place.</p>
                    <p>In some agile environments there may not be as much emphasis given to the concept of a formal
                        business case, possibly for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams talk in terms of the delivery of ‘value’ instead.</li>
                        <li>The most common agile ways of working focus more on the value of delivering individual
                            features rather than assessing the totality of the features as a whole in advance. Work is
                            prioritized (in a product backlog) by a product owner, in an ongoing manner, based on value
                            and maximizing that value. In effect this plays the role of a business case and is
                            authorized by the product owner.
                        </li>

                    <p>It is important to understand that in some agile environments this does not mean that a business case is not
                        needed or is undesirable; it may just be assumed that one exists or that the rationale for the work being
                        undertaken has already been justified.</p>

                    <p>Scrum for example starts with a backlog of features – when Scrum is used in a project context it assumes
                        that this backlog has already been created. In a BAU environment, a backlog will already exist and each entry
                        on the backlog is prioritized on its relative merits in relation to the value it will deliver. In a project
                        environment, upfront work is required (such as creating a backlog) and this would include the evolution of a
                        business case, which would need to be authorized before delivery work could commence. A mature agile
                        environment would cater for this although there isn’t a commonly agreed standard for how to do this or what
                        it would look like.</p>

                    <p>PRINCE2 Agile is based upon flexing what is delivered, and therefore the project board and the
                        project manager should be aware that the business case is affected by the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flexing what is delivered may directly affect the expected benefits (e.g. fewer features
                            than expected are delivered), so this needs to be appreciated when the business case is
                            created and maintained as benefits are likely to be expressed in the form of a range, which
                            relates to the amount delivered.
                        </li>
                        <li>After the project initiation documentation has been approved, time and cost tolerances, with
                            respect to overruns, may be set to zero in order to focus solely on managing the quantity of
                            what is delivered.
                        </li>
                        <li>The iterative and incremental delivery of products and sub-products aims to achieve the
                            early delivery of benefit. The frequency of these incremental deliveries and the benefits
                            they deliver can affect the business case both positively and negatively.
                        </li>
                        <li>How easy it is to deliver into the operational environment may also need to be taken into
                            account.
                        </li>
                        <li>The business case should clearly state what the minimum viable product (MVP) is and may give
                            an indication of when this will be delivered and whether it will be put into operational
                            use. The appropriate tolerances would be created around this so that if the project is
                            forecast to deliver the MVP late (or even not at all) then an exception condition occurs.
                            More information on MVP can be found in section 20.4.2.
                        </li>
                        <li>The viability of the project is a different concept from an MVP. At all times during a
                            project the project must remain viable and meet the needs of the business case.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>PRINCE2 uses the business case and the Business Case theme throughout a project to provide a firm
                        basis upon which agile concepts and techniques can be used effectively in the knowledge that the
                        strategic alignment and business justification are in place. Mature agile organizations would already have these in place.</p>
                    <p>One way to present a business case is to describe best-case and worst-case scenarios that relate
                        to the number of features that are planned to be delivered. The worst-case scenario (i.e. the
                        lowest expectation of the amount delivered) would need to clearly show that the project is still
                        viable. The best-case scenario could represent everything being delivered as planned. What would
                        be useful to the project board assessing the business case, in an agile context, is to be given
                        clear information on what is expected to be delivered, creating an expected case that is between
                        the two extremes although this will not necessarily be the mid-point.</p>
                    <p>These scenarios can only be calculated when using high-level or (perhaps) intermediate-level
                        requirements. It is unlikely that detailed requirements can be mapped directly to the business
                        case.</p>
                    <p>When using agile, the business case (along with the project product description) will have much
                        more emphasis on what features are being delivered and when partial deliveries or releases can
                        be expected, and with them the benefits that will be achieved.</p>
                    <p>The business case is mandatory in PRINCE2 and needs to be created by someone who has the
                        appropriate level of skill to create it correctly (e.g. it should be coherent, accurate and
                        strategically aligned).</p>
                    <p>In situations of high uncertainty it may be appropriate that the creation of a business case
                        takes very little time, so that tests can be carried out quickly in order to validate it (see
                        section 20.4.2 on the Lean Startup method).</p>
                    <h2>9.4 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                    <h3>9.4.1 Defining value</h3>
                    <p>Agile usually refers to ‘value’ whereas PRINCE2 usually refers to ‘benefits’. Although not
                        precisely the same thing the terms are often interchangeable (see section 9.4.2).</p>
                    <h4>9.4.1.1 Agile and value</h4>
                    <p>The very first principle of the Agile Manifesto refers to delivering value, but there is very
                        little guidance in most agile sources on how to determine and define ‘value’. The reason for
                        this is because it is usually difficult to define and often involves subjectivity.</p>
                    <p>Another reason why this situation exists is because the most common agile frameworks are focused
                        at the delivery level under the assumption that the work in general has already been justified.
                        In some agile environments, this assessment of value takes place at the lowest levels of detail,
                        which is probably the hardest place to do this.</p>
                    <h4>9.4.1.2 Calculating value</h4>
                    <p>Working out the value of carrying out a piece of work is easier at higher levels where some
                        degree of aggregation has occurred. Forecasting the savings a particular project could make will
                        normally be far easier than forecasting the savings that one particular requirement might
                        achieve. This is why assigning relative values to a long list of detailed requirements or user
                        stories will normally be quite subjective. A customer may find it easy to say that one user
                        story is more important than another user story, but they may find it difficult to quantify what
                        the value of each story actually is.</p>
                    <p>This may not always be the case, as there may be situations where the value measure being used
                        can be derived quickly from historical data and can easily be validated by customer feedback. An
                        example of this would be the desire to increase traffic to a website. In this scenario other
                        websites could be analysed to see how beneficial certain features proved to be; then after
                        implementing the feature, hard data would be available to measure the impact.</p>
                    <p>But even in the previous example measuring value may not be as straightforward as it looks.
                        Should the customer be measuring the increase of visitors to a website or should they be
                        measuring the increase in time spent on the website? Perhaps they shouldn’t be measuring either
                        and they should be focusing on how much revenue the website is generating.</p>
                    <p>Measures drive behaviours; therefore it is important to use the correct measure of value.</p>
                    <h4>9.4.1.3 Measuring value</h4>
                    <p>Measuring value can be quite difficult due to the fact there are so many things that may give
                        value, such as increasing revenue, reducing costs, retaining customers, reducing risks, meeting
                        regulatory targets, customer satisfaction, brand improvement and so on.</p>
                    <p>It is important to understand what kind of value is needed and to quantify it at the project
                        level (i.e. in the business case). This will then help when assigning relative values at the
                        delivery team level, because these people are working with the detail.</p>
                    <p>One thing that is more important than building the product right is to build the right
                        product.</p>
                    <h3>9.4.2 Defining benefits and value – an example</h3>
                    <p>The following call centre scenario is intended to provide a guide to how benefits and value could
                        be assessed at the beginning of a project and during it. The intention is to highlight how
                        difficult this can be but at the same time illustrate its importance – and also demonstrate the
                        way in which a project team working in an agile way can respond and adapt to the circumstances
                        happening around them.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">We need to close more customer incidents on the first call! We need a knowledge management (KM)
                        system!</blockquote>
                    <p>Change in an organization can start from anywhere. There may be a problem to solve or an
                        opportunity to take. Although the idea can come from anywhere it needs to be authorized at the
                        right level and in the right way (e.g. at a strategic level).</p>
                    <p>Once a project begins to come into existence, it is essential to define the ultimate benefit and
                        value that will be delivered. Asking for a KM system is asking for what PRINCE2 refers to as an
                        output. Assuming that the KM system will result in more calls/incidents being closed on the
                        first call, this is what PRINCE2 refers to as an outcome. However, more important than both of
                        these are the benefit and value that are ultimately delivered. PRINCE2 refers primarily to
                        benefit, whereas agile refers more frequently to value: although they are similar they are not
                        the same and this is explored in the rest of this chapter. Value is sometimes referred to as
                        ‘net benefit’ as it represents the benefits after the expenditure has been factored in.</p>

                            Tip<br> AXELOS’s Management of Value (MoV) says that value is subjective, with different people
                            applying different criteria to assess whether they are getting good value. It is this
                            subjectivity that makes it so essential to manage value deliberately, instead of leaving it
                            as a by-product of any other management activity. Added value is provided by the
                            delivery of enhanced, but useful, benefits and more effective use of resources. Not all
                            perceived benefits are actually necessary. MoV provides a means of distinguishing
                            between needs and wants. Likewise the supply of resources is often (indeed usually)
                            limited. Effective expenditure is essential to make the most of what is available.<br>
                            MoV recognizes that not all benefits are financial and that the differing priorities of key
                            stakeholders need to be considered and reconciled. Expenditure must cover short- and
                            long-term needs and recognize that resources are finite and must be conserved.<br>
                            Balancing and reconciling these conflicting demands, to maximize value, is one of the
                            core principles of MoV.

                    <h4>9.4.2.1 Points to consider when starting a project</h4>
                    <p>To correctly initiate a project, it is important to understand why it is taking place and what the best course of
                        action is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why is it assumed that a KM system will close more calls on the first call?</li>
                        <li>What is the significance of closing an incident on the first call? Why is that different
                            from closing an incident in two calls?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Spending time to work out exactly what the problem (or opportunity) is and how to solve it is essential to
                        getting a project off to a good start.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for wanting a KM system could be that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If more information from around the company is made available, the information would be available to
                            help close more calls on the first call.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The reason for wanting to close calls on the first call could be that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Existing measurements and metrics within the organization show that to re-visit an incident takes 25%
                            more time in total because subsequent calls need to cover the same information again (e.g. customer
                            details and security). This in turn is leading to the need to hire many temporary workers over and above
                            the existing company headcount, and temporary personnel are relatively expensive.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>9.4.2.2 Clarifying the output, outcome and benefit (or value)</h4>
                    <p>Investigating the thinking behind the desire for a KM system can drive out the real reasoning
                        behind it. Continually asking ‘why?’ can help to determine the answer, and may result in a
                        well-defined statement such as:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">We want a KM system (output) so that we can close 80% of all incident calls on the first call
                        (outcome) in order to reduce the workload in the call centre by 10% so that we will not need to
                        hire as many temporary workers, and this will save us £200K per year (benefit).</blockquote>
                    <p>Importantly, the outcome and benefits are now measurable. However, it is important to measure the
                        current situation as well so that progress can be monitored (e.g. the percentage of calls closed
                        on the first call is currently standing at 63%).</p>
                    <h4>9.4.2.3 What if things change?</h4>
                    <p>Assuming that the project has gone ahead, working in an agile way would focus on getting feedback
                        as early as possible by the early delivery of features that should be of benefit and value.</p>
                    <p>If the new KM system was a 12-month project it may be appropriate to deliver certain important
                        and useful features in the early months that are intended to help close calls on the first call.
                        This then gives a chance to measure how effective they are.</p>
                    <p>After six months, if the percentage of closed calls on the first call has improved to 70% (from
                        63%) then this would probably be seen as a good sign. However, this is still an outcome. Has the
                        expected benefit been achieved in saving the expense of the temporary workers? It may be the
                        case that there is no reduction in the temporary personnel. A project that is benefit- or
                        value-focused will react to this, whereas a project that is output-focused will continue to
                        build the KM system (as this is what it has been asked to do).</p>
                    <p>As a surprise, what if the customer satisfaction ratings for the call centre have gone up
                        recently by 4% due to the increase in calls closed on the first call? Perhaps the happier
                        customers (due to calls being closed on the first call) are resulting in more calls to the sales
                        teams, which in turn is resulting in more calls to the call centre! Which is why the number of
                        temporary workers has not reduced.</p>
                    <p>Seeing that the KM system may be delivering benefit and value, but not quite in the way it was
                        anticipated, can allow the project management team and the delivery teams to adjust how they
                        work and what they work on.</p>
                    <p>It may be that certain premium customers are so impressed with the improved incident resolution
                        time that they are buying other products and they do so in large volumes. Therefore, if the call
                        centre focused more on closing premium customers’ calls on the first call, this would deliver
                        more benefits and value than with the original outcome, yet still deliver a KM system (the
                        output).</p>
                    <p>Revising the earlier request may therefore be:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">We want a KM system (output) so that we can close 90% of all incident calls from premium
                        customers on the first call (outcome) in order to increase their customer satisfaction ratings
                        by 3% so that we get an increase in sales of new products of £300K per year (benefit).</blockquote>
                    <h4>9.4.2.4 The need to focus on benefits and value</h4>
                    <p>To deliver as much benefit and value as possible it is important to be able to measure and track
                        them. It is also important to be able to adjust the work taking place to maximize this. As
                        feedback is received it will affect the priority of the requirements. This may generate new
                        requirements that are essential (e.g. we need to know if a call is from a premium customer).
                        This is why the business case needs to be flexible in that the benefits can be achieved by
                        adjusting the originally defined outcomes and outputs, and therefore the setting of the
                        appropriate tolerances (e.g. for scope, quality criteria and benefits) becomes important.</p>
                    <h4>9.4.2.5 How collaboration helps</h4>
                    <p>If the feedback being received by the early delivery of features is not quite what was expected,
                        it is desirable if this is handled collaboratively by everyone on the project from the project
                        board to the delivery teams – by the customer and the supplier. Agile teams respond to change.
                        To react well to changes in circumstances means that anyone representing the customer needs to
                        seize the opportunity to adjust the course of the project by working out what is happening and
                        why, and then reprioritize accordingly. Equally, anyone from the supplier side needs to make
                        clear what is possible (e.g. ‘Have you thought of this?’, ‘We could do it that way.’) More
                        benefit and value are likely to be delivered if the team collaboratively focuses on benefits and
                        value in preference to focusing on just the output. This is why the contractual side of the
                        relationship needs to support this as much as possible.</p>
                    <h2>9.5 BUSINESS CASE THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>The popularity of PRINCE2 has had a significant impact on many organizations in terms of getting
                        business cases created for most projects. Many agile frameworks do not have the concept of a
                        business case, whereas in PRINCE2 it is mandatory. This provides an essential element to ensure
                        that the project has been started correctly. Having a business case is one thing, but writing a
                        good business case is another, and in PRINCE2 Agile it needs to be flexible and written on the
                        assumption that what is being delivered will change in order to maximize the expected benefits
                        of the project.</p>
                    <p>The Business Case theme supports the continued justification for the project and therefore helps
                        to clarify the big picture. This in turn enables the decision-making that is being made at the
                        more detailed levels to have a clearly defined position in this wider context and not just where
                        requirements exist in isolation.</p>

                            Tip<br> For any situation that arises on a project, a key question (for anyone) to ask is ‘How does
                            this affect the business case?’ This represents the bigger picture or, to put it another way,
                            the main thing is to keep the business case as the main focus.

                    <p>As outlined in section 9.4.2, the skill of crafting a well-written project product description and business case
                        will always be needed. Amongst other things this is essential to ensure a project’s success but also to detect
                        as quickly as possible if a project is no longer viable.</p>
