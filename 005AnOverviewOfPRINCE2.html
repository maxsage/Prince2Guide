                <p>PRINCE2 should only be used for managing projects. The ‘temporary organization’ needs to be big
                    enough or complex enough to justify producing a business case and setting up project management
                    controls. If the work can be managed simply as a ‘line management’ task, using PRINCE2 could create
                    an inappropriate management overhead.</p>

                <h2>5.1 THE STRUCTURE OF PRINCE2</h2>
                <p>The PRINCE2 method addresses project management with four integrated elements of principles, themes,
                    processes and the project environment (see Figure 5.2).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Principles are the guiding obligation of good practice enshrined in PRINCE2.</li>
                    <li>The themes provide guidance on how the activities are to be performed.</li>
                    <li>The processes give a model for how the project will be managed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>5.2 THE PRINCIPLES</h2>
                <p>The seven PRINCE2 principles are the guiding obligations for good practice that a project should
                    follow if it is using PRINCE2. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A PRINCE2 project has continued business justification.</li>
                    <li>PRINCE2 project teams learn from previous experience (lessons are sought, recorded and acted
                        upon throughout the life of the project).
                    </li>
                    <li>A PRINCE2 project has defined and agreed roles and responsibilities within an organization
                        structure that engages the business, user and supplier stakeholder interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>A PRINCE2 project is planned, monitored and controlled on a stage-by-stage basis (management by
                        stages).
                    </li>
                    <li>A PRINCE2 project has defined tolerances for each project objective to establish limits of
                        delegated authority (management by exception).
                    </li>
                    <li>A PRINCE2 project focuses on the definition and delivery of products, in particular their scope
                        and quality requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRINCE2 is tailored to suit the project’s environment, size, complexity, importance, capability
                        and risk.
                    </li>

                            decision-making in its (continued) investment.<br> The project starts with an idea which is
                            considered to have potential value for the organization concerned. This theme addresses how
                            the idea is developed into a viable investment proposition for the organization and how
                            project management maintains the focus on the organization’s objectives throughout the

                            allocate the work to managers who will be responsible for it and steer it through to
                            completion. Projects are crossfunctional so the normal line function structures are not
                            suitable. This theme describes the roles and responsibilities in the temporary PRINCE2
                            project management team required to manage the project effectively.

                            broad outline. This theme explains how the outline is developed so that all participants
                            understand the quality attributes of the products to be delivered – and then how project
                            management will ensure that these requirements are subsequently delivered.

                            approved plans. This theme complements the Quality theme by describing the steps required to
                            develop plans and the PRINCE2 techniques that should be applied. In PRINCE2 the plans are
                            matched to the needs of the personnel at various levels of the organization. They are the
                            focus for communication and control throughout the project.

                            than stable operational activity. This theme addresses how project management manages the

                            (its plans and completed products). Issues may be unanticipated general problems, requests

                        <td>The purpose of the Progress theme is to establish mechanisms to monitor and compare actual
                            achievements against those planned; provide a forecast for the project objectives and the
                            project’s continual viability; and control any unacceptable deviations.<br> This theme
                            addresses the ongoing viability of the plans. The theme explains the decision-making process
                            for approving plans, the monitoring of actual performance and the escalation process if
                            events do not go according to plan. Ultimately, the Progress theme determines whether and
                            how the project should proceed.

                <h2>5.3 THE THEMES</h2>
                <p>The PRINCE2 themes describe aspects of project management that must be addressed continually (see
                    Table 5.1).</p>
                <p>In summary, the set of PRINCE2 themes describe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How baselines are established (in the Business Case and Plans themes). The baselines cover all
                        six project performance targets – benefits, risks, scope, quality, cost and time – and act as
                        key reference points for subsequent monitoring and control.
                    </li>
                    <li>How the project management team monitors and controls the work as the project progresses (in the
                        Progress, Quality, Change and Risk themes).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Organization theme underpins the other themes with a secure structure of roles, clarifying
                    accountability and offering clear paths for delegation and escalation.</p>
                <h2>5.4 THE PROCESSES</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 provides a process model for managing a project. The processes can easily be scaled and
                    tailored to suit the requirements of all types of project. They consist of a set of activities that
                    are required to direct, manage and deliver a project.</p>
                <h2>5.5 THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENT</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 can be used on projects irrespective of project scale, complexity, geography, culture etc.
                    PRINCE2 can also be used whether the project is part of a programme or being managed as a
                    stand-alone initiative. This reflects the principle that PRINCE2 must be tailored to suit the
                    particular project context.</p>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile is an example of such tailoring designed to suit a context when a project is taking
                    place in an agile environment.</p>
