                <h2>1.1 WHAT IS PRINCE2 AGILE?</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile describes how to configure and tune PRINCE2 so that PRINCE2 can be used in the most
                    effective way when combining it with agile behaviours, concepts, frameworks and techniques.</p>
                <h2>1.2 PRINCE2 AGILE IS FOR PROJECTS ONLY</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile are only suitable for use on projects, whereas agile can be used for
                    projects and routine ongoing work as well. Throughout this manual, routine ongoing work is referred
                    to as ‘business as usual’ (BAU) and covers such areas as ongoing product development, product
                    maintenance and continual improvement.</p>
                <p>The distinction between project work and BAU work (see Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1) is important because
                    some of the agile ways of working need to be applied differently in each situation. Therefore, when
                    carrying out a piece of work it is important to understand the type of work being undertaken, to
                    ensure that it is addressed in the appropriate way and that agile is used appropriately.</p>
                <h2>1.2.1 What does BAU look like?</h2>
                <p>BAU work would typically be repeatable routine tasks that can be carried out by people with the
                    appropriate technical skills without needing to be managed by a project manager. An example of this
                    would be where modifications or enhancements need to be made to an existing product and the
                    timescales are relatively short. There would usually be a long list of these tasks arriving
                    regularly throughout the lifespan of the product. There may be an established team dedicated to this
                    work.</p>
                <h2>1.2.2 What does a project look like?</h2>
                <p>A project is a temporary situation, where a team is assembled to address a specific problem,
                    opportunity or change that is sufficiently difficult that it cannot be handled as BAU. It may even
                    be a collection of BAU items handled collectively. An example of a project would be where a new
                    product or service is being created – there may be a need to engage many stakeholders and a
                    significant amount of uncertainty exists. The project team may be based in different locations, the
                    team personnel may change, the project may last a long time and it may be part of a wider programme
                    of work. Importantly, it needs to be managed by a project manager.</p>

                        Tip<br> AXELOS’s Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) provides best-practice guidance for
                        managing related projects and activities in programmes of work that deliver business benefits

                <p>Figure 1.1 illustrates the different characteristics of project work in comparison with BAU work. A
                    project has defined stages for upfront work before any delivery activity commences. It also has
                    layers of project management and project direction to ensure the correct output is ultimately
                    arrived at. By the end a project, at which point the project team disbands (or moves to other work),
                    the product created will have gone into operational use, and from then on it may be maintained and
                    enhanced in a BAU environment.

                        goal or meet an objective. The deadline should not be moved, as the method of managing a timebox
                        is to prioritize the work inside it. At a low level, a timebox will last a matter of days or
                        weeks (e.g. a sprint). Higher-level timeboxes act as aggregated timeboxes and contain
                        lower-level timeboxes (e.g. stages)
