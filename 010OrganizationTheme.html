                <h2>10.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE ORGANIZATION THEME</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the Organization theme is to define and establish the project’s structure of
                    accountability and responsibilities (the who?).</p>
                <h3>10.1.1 Three project interests</h3>
                <p>The PRINCE2 principle of defined roles and responsibilities states that a PRINCE2 project will always
                    have three primary categories of stakeholder, and the interests of all three must be satisfied if
                    the project is to be successful. Figure 10.1 shows the three primary interests which make up the
                    project board. PRINCE2 recommends that for completeness the project board should include
                    representation from each of the business, user and supplier interests at all times.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business</strong> The products of the project should meet a business need which will
                        justify the investment in the project. The project should also provide value for money.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>User</strong> PRINCE2 makes a distinction between the business interests and the
                        requirements of those who will use the project’s outputs. The user presence is needed to specify
                        the desired outputs and ensure that the project delivers them. The senior user(s) will represent
                        this stakeholder interest on the project board.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Supplier</strong> The creation of the project’s outputs will need resources with certain
                        skills. The supplier viewpoint should represent those who will provide the necessary skills and
                        produce the project product. The senior supplier(s) will represent this stakeholder interest on
                        the project board.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>10.1.2 The project management team</h3>
                <h4>10.1.2.1 Project management team structure</h4>
                <p>A project management team is a temporary structure specifically designed to manage the project to its
                    successful conclusion. The structure allows for channels of communication to decision-making forums
                    and should be backed up by role descriptions that specify the responsibilities, goals, limits of
                    authority, relationships, skills, knowledge and experience required for all roles in the project
                    management team. Figure 10.2 illustrates the structure of the project management team and its
                    reporting lines.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <h4>10.1.2.2 Dealing with changes to the project management team</h4>
                <p>Ideally, the project manager and project board members should stay with the project throughout its
                    life. In practice, however, this may not always be possible and the project management team may
                    change during the project. A clearly defined team structure, together with comprehensive role
                    descriptions outlining the responsibilities for each role, should help to alleviate disruption
                    caused by project management team changes.</p>
                <p>The use of management stages also allows a smooth transition for changes to the project management
                    team. Project roles should be reviewed for the next stage during the Managing a Stage Boundary
                    process. The use of end stage reports and stage plans can help to ensure that any handover procedure
                    is thorough and well documented. Although ideally the project executive and project manager should
                    stay with the project throughout its lifecycle, a stage boundary provides an opportunity to hand
                    over the role during the project if this is necessary.</p>
                <h3>10.1.3 Working with the corporate organization</h3>
                <h4>10.1.3.1 Centre of excellence</h4>
                <p>The concept of a centre of excellence is that of a central standards unit, which defines standards
                    (such as processes, templates and tools), and provides skills, training and possibly independent
                    assurance functions to a number of projects.</p>
                <p>A centre of excellence can be useful where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resource shortages, either in numbers or skills, make it difficult to supply people to perform
                        project administration for each current project
                    </li>
                    <li>There are a number of small projects of a diverse nature that individually require only limited
                        support from project support
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a large programme, requiring coordination of individual projects</li>
                    <li>A large project requires several resources to handle project support roles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Refer to AXELOS’s Portfolio, Programme and Project Offices (OGC, 2008) for further information on the
                    centre of excellence and its relationship to projects.</p>
                <h2>10.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE ORGANIZATION THEME</h2>
                <p>There is a wide variety of structures and ways of organizing teams across the whole agile spectrum.
                    Some agile approaches such as DSDM describe several roles with clearly defined levels of
                    accountability and responsibility, whereas others such as Kanban define none. Scrum sits somewhere
                    in between these two views as it has a few roles but these roles only apply to product delivery.</p>
                <p>Agile puts a lot of emphasis on the way a team operates in that it should self-organize, be
                    empowered, remain stable and have a large amount of autonomy. This creates a feeling of the team
                    being collectively responsible for what it delivers, which contrasts with the view that the person
                    in charge of the team is solely responsible. It also prefers the team members to be multi-skilled
                    (i.e. they can offer more than one discipline) as much as possible.</p>
                <h3>10.2.1 Common viewpoints of agile and roles</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking the most well-known and well-defined agile roles operate at the product delivery
                    level with relatively little reference made to roles which sit above this (e.g. sponsorship,
                    technical strategy). A mature agile environment would have clearly defined roles that are
                    responsible for such areas as vision and product roadmaps (e.g. a sponsor or a product manager). A
                    summary of how agile views certain common roles is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Scrum master</strong> A common role in agile is that of the Scrum master, who is
                        seen as a servant leader (see section 10.5.1). The Scrum master facilitates and coaches the
                        Scrum process whilst removing impediments identified by the team working at the delivery level.
                        It could be said that there is no equivalent role in PRINCE2. The team manager is the most
                        obvious candidate, but in Scrum and in many agile belief systems the team does not need to be
                        ‘managed’ per se – it needs to be ‘led and coached’. When using agile in a PRINCE2 environment
                        there will need to be a team manager or equivalent who is ultimately accountable for the
                        delivery of a team’s products, but this will need to be handled appropriately as described in
                        section 10.4.1.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The product owner</strong> Another common and perhaps pivotal role in agile is that of
                        the product owner, and this role is often regarded as the key stakeholder. It is difficult to
                        draw a simple parallel with a PRINCE2 role as it depends on the number of delivery teams
                        involved on a project. Even making a general rule is difficult as there may be many teams with
                        many product owners. The product owner role is discussed in detail in section 10.5.2. The
                        business ambassador role in DSDM is similar to this. 76 PRINCE2 Agile
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The project manager (and team manager)</strong> There is a significant body of opinion
                        in the agile community that suggests there is no longer a need for the project manager role.
                        This view is quite significant and has arisen primarily for two reasons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a view that any work can be carried out and managed as if it were BAU by
                                breaking the work down to a size and a level of certainty that allows it to be handled
                                as routine work.
                            </li>
                            <li>The term ‘manager’ is regarded as having negative connotations to many in the agile
                                community as it infers a lack of trust in the people who make up the team – the belief
                                being that they do not need a manager as they manage themselves collectively though
                                self-organization.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile see the project manager role as essential for a project, although in
                        an agile context the behaviours, relationships and responsibilities may be emphasized
                        differently.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The requirements engineer/business analyst</strong> The most common agile approaches
                        give little prominence to a specific role for gathering the requirements for a project (e.g. a
                        requirements engineer or business analyst). This role is usually undertaken by the product
                        owner.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>10.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE FOR THE ORGANIZATION THEME</h2>
                <p>Adding the project management team structure from PRINCE2 to the delivery-based roles of agile
                    creates a very powerful combination. In simple terms the synchronization between these two is quite
                    straightforward in that PRINCE2 provides very little specific guidance at the delivery/technical
                    level, and similarly the most common agile frameworks provide very little specific guidance with
                    respect to the roles of project management and project governance/direction. This is described at
                    the beginning of Chapter 3 of this guide and illustrated in Figure 3.1.</p>
                <p>The ease at which PRINCE2 and agile can be blended together depends upon the nature of the work
                    involved. As soon as a piece of work involves more than just a few people and is difficult (i.e. it
                    needs to be run as a project), there is a requirement to have clearly defined roles and
                    responsibilities so that the correct communication and decisions can be taken at the right time and
                    at the appropriate level (see Table 10.1).</p>

                <p>In a mature agile environment the contrasting concepts of the roles needed for a project context and
                    how they integrate with the roles that commonly appear in agile will probably have been aligned. The
                    concept that there is a need to represent a customer and a supplier (i.e. someone who wants the
                    product and someone who builds the product) in some form – roles as opposed to job titles – is the
                    same in PRINCE2 as it is in agile. However, there are concepts which are different.</p>
                <h2>10.4 DIFFERENT CONCEPTS REGARDING ROLES BETWEEN PRINCE2 AND AGILE</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 operates in any environment and on a project of any size from something simple and
                    straightforward to something more challenging. Some commonly used agile concepts and roles may
                    therefore need to be adjusted and the following guidance applies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agile delivery teams prefer to be led and coached as opposed to managed</strong>. Much
                        of the agile way of working is founded on teams being self-organized and collectively
                        responsible for what they deliver. The Scrum master is seen as a coach and a servant leader to
                        the team and not a manager of the team. PRINCE2 defines the role of team manager, which has
                        clear accountability at the team/delivery level; the mapping of this to any role in an agile
                        team is not straightforward and needs to be handled appropriately (see section 10.4.1).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Common agile guidance refers to a single product owner.</strong> If a project involves
                        more than just a handful of people and needs to canvass the views of several stakeholders and
                        perhaps conflicting views from the customer’s side, PRINCE2 Agile recommends taking a more
                        blended view of the customer rather than listening to one single voice. This would mean engaging
                        with the customer at different levels of authority and ensuring that all areas of expertise were
                        included in the decision-making and communication process (see sections 10.4.1 and 10.5.2).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Common agile guidance does not have a project manager role.</strong> Unsurprisingly,
                        PRINCE2 sees this role as mandatory on the basis that if a piece of work is difficult enough to
                        be classed as a project then it requires someone to carry out the role of managing it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>10.4.1 Integrating the PRINCE2 team manager role into an agile delivery team</h3>
                <p>A PRINCE2 team manager has a clearly defined set of responsibilities which cover five areas as shown
                    in the left-hand column of Table 10.2. The table also shows how these responsibilities correspond to

                <p>The team manager role in PRINCE2 needs to integrate with the delivery team as shown in Figure
                    10.3.</p>
                <h3>10.4.2 Relationship types linking the project manager and the delivery team</h3>
                <p>There are three options available when integrating an agile delivery team into a PRINCE2 project
                    structure with respect to the team manager role. The key point is that the project manager needs to
                    liaise with the team in the five areas of responsibility described earlier in Table 10.2 (see
                    Appendix B for descriptions of roles). </p>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile does not have a preference for any one of the three options outlined in Table 10.3 as
                    it will depend on the maturity of the delivery team and the relationship between the project manager
                    and the delivery team. It may be that the project board, who are ultimately accountable for the
                    project, express a preference or make a decision.</p>

                <p>These three options could be said to represent a range from ‘very agile’ (at the top) to ‘less agile’
                    (at the bottom) and could be a sign of how mature an organization is with respect to the agile ways
                    of working. However, each project has its own set of unique circumstances and the choice should be
                    made according to those circumstances.</p>
                <p>The relationship between the project manager and the delivery team is one of the most important areas
                    to get right when using PRINCE2 and agile together. This may need to be defined as part of a work
                    package, and it should be defined in the project initiation documentation as this is where the
                    project board (and perhaps the project manager) will need to agree on an appropriate interface
                    between the project manager and the team manager/delivery team. Potentially, the relationship may be
                    different from team to team.</p>
                <p>How to integrate the responsibilities of the team manager into an agile delivery team is ultimately
                    about balancing the needs of the project board and the project manager to enable them to direct and
                    manage the project whilst at the same time creating an environment for the teams that motivates and
                    empowers the people delivering the products.</p>
                <h3>10.4.3 The composition of a delivery team</h3>
                <p>There is no mention of the composition of the delivery team in PRINCE2. This is for two reasons.
                    Firstly, PRINCE2 operates in a variety of situations and industry sectors; therefore defining
                    delivery teams is difficult as there are a wide variety of disciplines to cover. Secondly, the
                    technical delivery aspects of a project are separate from project management and project direction.
                    All that is required by PRINCE2 is the clarification of the relationship between the project manager
                    and the team manager. Agile does define the roles in and around a delivery team, and they would
                    usually represent some or all of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone to lead the team</li>
                    <li>Someone from the customer (or at least someone to represent the customer)</li>
                    <li>A team to create the product</li>
                    <li>Someone to assure the quality of the product</li>
                    <li>Someone to coach the team (which includes coaching them in agile).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>How many of each role will vary according to the needs of the delivery team. One person could do more
                    than one role (e.g. lead the team and coach it). Several people could carry out one role (e.g.
                    create the product). Some roles may be peripheral to the delivery team (e.g. from customer areas
                    that provide relatively minor input). A typical guide for the size of a team is seven, plus or minus
                    two. It may be better for delivery teams that are larger than this to be divided into more than one
                    team.</p>
                <p>Many agile roles appear to assume an IT context: therefore role descriptions can look very much like
                    IT roles, using terms such as ‘developer’ and ‘business analyst’. There is usually very little
                    mention of roles such as engineer, designer, editor etc. PRINCE2 Agile provides the following set of
                    generic roles that can be used if desired (see Appendix B):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer subject matter expert</li>
                    <li>Customer representative (usually outside the delivery team)</li>
                    <li>Supplier subject matter expert</li>
                    <li>Supplier representative (usually outside the delivery team)</li>
                    <li>Delivery team quality assurance (QA).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>10.4.3.1 Multi-skilled people and roles</h4>
                <p>Many in the agile community promote the idea of teams made up of multi-skilled people, where any team
                    member can do any other team member’s job. Others agree with having more than one skill, but prefer
                    some degree of specialization. There is very little appetite for single-function roles in an agile
                    delivery team, as this makes self-organizing and the ability to respond to delays very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>Organizations developing their agile capability and looking to broaden people’s skill-sets need to
                    allow enough time for this transition to take place. When using PRINCE2 with agile it is recommended
                    to aim for delivery teams that are made up of ‘generalizing specialists’ (sometimes referred to as
                    ‘T-shaped’ people as they have a lot of depth in one particular skill, and a breadth of knowledge,
                    to a limited degree, in other skills). This creates a team where everyone has a core skill, but they
                    also have the ability to help out other team members (to some degree) in other areas of
                    expertise.</p>
                <p>Further to this, the whole project management team needs to be set up in such a way that any
                    stakeholder who needs to contribute is aware of their role (e.g. to provide information or to assure
                    deliverables). Various techniques such as RACI (see box) exist for analysing stakeholder involvement
                    – assessing the contribution, commitment and support levels of stakeholders in terms of whether or
                    not their involvement is critical, desirable or non-essential. Such techniques can be used to ensure
                    that the project management team is set up correctly and that the communication management strategy
                    complements this. Ultimately, all of this will be approved by the project board.</p>
                <p>It is essential that the delivery teams are clearly empowered, as they will be responsible for
                    self-organizing and delivering products that are fit for purpose. Ensuring that the people in the
                    delivery teams are appropriately trained in agile may also be needed. A lot of agile training is
                    focused on specific delivery roles such as the product owner, the Scrum master and the agile coach,
                    and corresponding qualifications also exist.</p>

                <p>In some senses, PRINCE2 has no interest in the inner workings of a delivery team. It uses the work
                    package and the Managing Product Delivery process to ensure that the required product is delivered.
                    However, to fully embrace agile, the PRINCE2 project team, and particularly the project manager,
                    need to be aware of how people using agile work and behave – specifically at the delivery level.
                    They must not meddle or interfere with the delivery teams as this is likely to be
                    counter-productive, but the project manager needs to understand how agile is helping the project:
                    this applies across the project as a whole and not just at the delivery level.</p>
                <p>A PRINCE2 project manager using agile will be interested in how the delivery teams are working when
                    liaising with their team managers. Therefore, they need to be aware of the delivery team roles and
                    their typical behaviours.</p>
                <h3>10.4.4 Single-team project structure</h3>
                <p>If a project is small enough to be addressed by one team where the roles of project manager and team
                    manager are combined, an expected configuration of the customer and supplier roles would look
                    something like that shown in Figure 10.4.</p>

                    <li>Supplier subject matter experts (SSMEs) would typically be full-time.</li>
                    <li>Customer subject matter experts (CSMEs) may be full-time or part-time depending on their role
                        within the organization as a whole (i.e. they may have a ‘day job’ as well as a role on a
                        project).
                    </li>
                    <li>On a single-team project the high-level view of the customer could be covered entirely by the
                        senior user role, although other customer representatives at this level may be formally
                        involved.
                    </li>
                    <li>The detailed view could be covered by one CSME, although more than one CSME on a small project
                        is quite normal when using PRINCE2 Agile. This will typically be similar to the product owner
                        role, although in a basic agile context there is usually only one product owner.

                    manager, and a typical configuration of the customer and supplier roles would look something like

                <ol>
                    <li>There may be more than one person wishing to contribute to the high-level customer view as a
                        senior user. In a mature agile environment, if there is one person ultimately responsible at
                        this level, then this is sometimes referred to as a ‘super product owner’, ‘senior product
                        owner’ or ‘product manager’. The senior user role does not typically map to the role of product
                        owner found in a delivery team.</li>
                    <li>A customer representative may wish to contribute to both the high-level and the detailed-level
                        understanding of a project.
                    </li>
                    <li>A customer subject matter expert (CSME) is the focal point for all information about the
                        customer at the detailed level. They act as a conduit to the delivery team for all views that
                        need to be taken into consideration from any customer representative who is impacted or who may
                        wish to contribute. The high-level view is provided by the senior user.
                    </li>
                    <li>A customer representative may contribute to more than one team at the detailed level.</li>
                    <li>A team may have more than one CSME. It may be appropriate to determine any reporting lines
                        between CSMEs in the same team but usually this is not necessary.</li>
                    <li>Customer representatives need to have clearly assigned roles on a project, but their involvement
                        is significantly less than that of a CSME. They usually contribute specific knowledge from
                        certain areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>A coach may exist as a person carrying out a specific role in a delivery team or the role could
                        be covered by a person who is also carrying out another role for the team (e.g. team manager).
                        Alternatively, a coach may work with several teams and be provided by project support.
                    </li>
                    <li>QA may be split into customer QA (CQA) and supplier QA (SQA) and could be carried out by people
                        from outside the delivery teams.
                    </li>
                    <li>A CSME could also carry out CQA.</li>

                <h3>10.4.6 Tailoring the PRINCE2 roles</h3>
                <p>Outside the delivery teams, PRINCE2 has agreed and identified roles and responsibilities. All of the
                    roles apply when using agile and their responsibilities do not need to change. However, each role
                    would need to be conversant with the fundamentals of working in an agile way. Additional guidance is
                    provided in Table 10.4.</p>
                <h2>10.5 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                <h3>10.5.1 Servant leadership</h3>
                <p>This concept or philosophy is usually advocated as a best practice for the person ‘leading’ a team at
                    the delivery level in an agile environment. The term ‘servant leader’ originates from books and
                    essays written by Robert K. Greenleaf in the 1970s, although it could be said to date back to
                    ancient history.</p>
                <h4>10.5.1.1 The basics</h4>
                <p>Although servant leadership can be used anywhere it is generally aimed at corporate or organizational
                    leadership, or those who ‘lead’ as opposed to those who ‘manage’. The term is referenced by the
                    Scrum method (although the term is not explained); through the wide adoption of Scrum, servant
                    leadership now has widespread adoption too as a concept, although how far it can be adopted is often
                    affected by existing organizational constraints.</p>
                <p>In simple terms the idea of servant leadership is that the best way to lead a team is to be a servant
                    to the team. Therefore, as a leader of a team you would put team members’ needs above yours. It
                    would be your role to ensure that everyone is looked after, that they are okay and they have what
                    they need. This in turn creates a happier, more effective and productive team, and performance
                    improves accordingly.</p>
                <p>When integrating agile with PRINCE2 this concept needs to be handled carefully, as it could be said
                    that some of PRINCE2 would be in conflict with the philosophy of servant leadership. An example of
                    this is where a team manager has clearly defined responsibilities such as planning and monitoring
                    the team’s work. Agile and servant leadership focus on everyone in the team as a whole being
                    responsible for how they work and what they produce. Therefore, creating a role for this will
                    automatically create a situation where the team may not feel that it is truly responsible. Even the
                    title of the role itself can produce this effect. However, PRINCE2 does not have a preferred style
                    of control and leadership, so it can support any style and this includes servant leadership.</p>
                <h4>10.5.1.2 Further information</h4>
                <p>The thing to focus on when using servant leadership with PRINCE2 is to create an environment for the
                    team where they do feel truly empowered and responsible for the way they work and the products they
                    produce, even if the team manager still remains ultimately responsible. This can be achieved by the
                    team manager leading by example and working collaboratively with the team to achieve this.</p>
                <p>When using PRINCE2 in an agile context, someone still needs to manage and lead the team, but by using
                    the style of a servant leader their focus will primarily (but not solely) be on helping and
                    supporting the team (i.e. serving). Therefore, leadership of the team is a secondary focus and comes
                    from how well the primary focus is achieved.</p>

                <p>In some cases different terminology is used to achieve the servant-leadership philosophy (e.g.
                    ‘facilitative’ leadership or ‘collaborative’ leadership).</p>
                <p>A lot of the thinking behind servant leadership is that people feel more valued when they work as
                    equals and share responsibility. This is in contrast to autocratic, dictatorial or authoritarian
                    leadership where those in charge enjoy the feeling of power and the kudos that comes with it.</p>
                <p>Servant leadership will fit into any PRINCE2 Agile role where leadership skills are needed (e.g.
                    project board, project manager and team manager) although certain areas of responsibility may need
                    to be defined. An example of this would be to clarify the difference between leadership and
                    management. Leadership normally refers to such things as vision, direction and the ability to
                    inspire. Management focuses more on the work to be done and the people doing the work. There is an
                    overlap between these two, as leaders sometimes need to manage people, and managers always need to
                    lead in some form.</p>
                <p>Some of the agile behaviours focus on collaboration, respect and honesty, which is very much in
                    keeping with the servant-leader philosophy; these behaviours would be typical of an agile team
                    manager managing a team with a servant-leader style.</p>
                <p>It is possible for a team to naturally select its own leader/Scrum master, and this may be anyone
                    from the team – not necessarily the most senior or most experienced.</p>
                <h4>10.5.1.3 Hints that may prove useful</h4>
                <p>A team manager running a team in a servant-leader style would create an environment to help grow and
                    develop team members. The team manager would be a team player, always coaching the team and building
                    consensus along the way. The same applies to a project manager in the wider context of a project
                    management team. Creating a culture where people are comfortable to ask for help, and when they do
                    it is welcomed, is a significant part of creating the right environment.</p>
                <p>To help further understand the typical attributes a servant leader would need, the following lists
                    may be of use.</p>
                <p>From Servant Leadership: A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness by Robert K.
                    Greenleaf (2002):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening</li>
                    <li>Empathy</li>
                    <li>Building community</li>
                    <li>Healing</li>
                    <li>Awareness</li>
                    <li>Commitment to the growth of people</li>
                    <li>Foresight</li>
                    <li>Persuasion</li>
                    <li>Stewardship</li>
                    <li>Conceptualization.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ann McGee-Cooper and Duane Trammell summarized servant leadership as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listen without judgement</li>
                    <li>Be authentic</li>
                    <li>Build community</li>
                    <li>Share power</li>
                    <li>Develop people</li>
                    <li>Co-create shared vision.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These attributes are ideal for any team, as this way of working builds on the behaviours that
                    personify agile, by creating empowered and creative teams working in an iterative style and
                    responding to change. Involving</p>
                <h4>10.5.1.4 Context is important</h4>
                <p>Servant leadership is a very powerful concept, and how far to utilize this depends on many factors.
                    One such factor affecting how effective this can be would depend on the context in which it was
                    being used. How open is a team, department or organization to this style of working? A mature agile
                    organization would use servant leadership and self-organization a lot. Another factor that could
                    limit servant leadership is that a project team is temporary and therefore needs time to grow and
                    bond, whereas an existing BAU team that is stable and has been together over a long period may have
                    evolved its own way of working.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, PRINCE2 can support as much or as little of this style of working as is desired because
                    it has no preferred style. There is nothing in PRINCE2 that limits this.</p>
                <h3>10.5.2 How to incorporate the wider customer view and the product owner role</h3>
                <p>In agile, the customer view is often represented by a role called the product owner. It is one of the
                    three Scrum roles and is hugely significant in agile terms: executing this role correctly is
                    critical to the successful use of agile because this role is so commonly used. This may require an
                    individual to be trained in how to be a product owner, or they may need the support of a proxy who
                    has the appropriate skills.</p>
                <p>However, there is a paradox with this role in that it is simple to define it and assign someone to
                    it, but this simplicity needs to be tailored when used in a project context – even when working in a
                    mature agile environment. The reason for this is that the product owner role is commonly associated
                    with a scenario where there is one team, one product, and work is ongoing such as in a BAU
                    environment. When using the product owner role in more challenging situations adjustments will
                    probably need to be made.</p>
                <h4>10.5.2.1 The basics</h4>
                <p>In simple terms the product owner is the ‘voice of the customer’ and this role covers the following
                    responsibilities as described in the Scrum Guide (see Appendix H):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clearly expressing product backlog items</li>
                    <li>Ordering the items in the product backlog to best achieve goals and missions</li>
                    <li>Optimizing the value of the work the development team performs</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear to all, and shows what the
                        Scrum team will work on next</li>
                    <li>Ensuring the development team understands items in the product backlog to the level needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other definitions of the product owner responsibilities in more mature agile environments include the
                    product vision, creating product roadmaps and business case justification.</p>
                <p>In terms of their attributes and style of working, a product owner should be:</p>
                <ul><li>Very knowledgeable of the customer domain</li>
                    <li>An effective communicator</li>
                    <li>Able to canvass the opinions of key stakeholders</li>
                    <li>Empowered</li>
                    <li>Clear on the vision for the product</li>
                    <li>Able to define requirements and user stories</li>
                    <li>Able to define what a successful outcome would look like</li>
                    <li>Available at all times to the delivery team.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, the product owner has the final say on everything to do with the final product. They own
                    it, and they are solely accountable for it. This means that the product owner has the authority to
                    decide what goes into the product, and they are not accountable to anyone else with respect to
                    having to justify it.</p>
                <h4>10.5.2.2 The simplicity of the product owner role</h4>
                <p>Crucial to this role, as commonly expressed in agile frameworks, is that there is only one person
                doing this. This creates the simplicity which many people (e.g. from the technical delivery side) find
                attractive as it creates a very clear single point of contact and a single version of the truth.</p>
                <p>The simplicity of the product owner role can work well in a straightforward BAU context, but there
                    are limitations when working on a project.</p>
                <h4>10.5.2.3 Limitations due to project size</h4>
                <p>Project teams (small or large) would typically require a wider and more representative view of a
                    customer’s interests than are perhaps required in a BAU situation.</p>
                <p>It may not be appropriate to have one person from the customer side responsible for the many views
                    and angles that exist on a project. There may be high-level views held by certain stakeholders that
                    need to be taken into account (e.g. strategic), along with other more detailed views from a
                    different set of stakeholders (e.g. to do with how the product looks).</p>
                <h4>10.5.2.4 Limitations due to size of the role in a project context</h4>
                <p>It is one thing to assign several responsibilities and attributes to a role, but it is something
                    different altogether to find an individual who can carry out that role effectively. The product
                    owner role contains some responsibilities that even in isolation may require advanced levels of
                    skill and may form a discipline (or role) in its own right, in the context of a project.</p>
                <p>Gathering requirements, defining them, facilitating communication with the wider customer community
                    of project stakeholders (which would include many contrasting perspectives) and creating buy-in to
                    the way forward is a significant undertaking for even the most experienced individual.</p>
                <p>This can be too much for one person as it involves a lot of work, and some of this work involves a
                    high degree of technical skill (e.g. requirements engineering).</p>
                <p>A project requires many customer roles in order to correctly reflect the customer’s view. A single
                    product owner may not be the best way to achieve this.</p>
                <h4>10.5.2.5 Representing the customer view on a project</h4>
                <p>A one-team, one-product BAU situation can operate very effectively with one product owner. More
                    challenging work needs to be structured as Figures 10.4 and 10.5 show. Most of the common agile
                    frameworks do not have the structures to accommodate this naturally, although DSDM is an exception
                    to this general rule and mature agile organizations will have created their own.</p>
                <p>The PRINCE2 Agile role of customer subject matter expert (CSME) is similar to product owner if it is
                    inside a delivery team, and it can still be referred to as ‘product owner’ if the team already uses
                    and understands this term and what the role entails. However, in a PRINCE2 Agile context this role
                    would take the general function of providing the customer’s voice at the detailed level. The senior
                    user would be responsible for the wider and higher-level customer view and also be ultimately
                    accountable for what goes into the final product. The executive would be responsible for the
                    business case.</p>
                <h4>10.5.2.6 Specialist role to support capturing the customer view</h4>
                <p>Another option is to have a role that can help to define the project’s products (often referred to as
                    requirements) by acting as a catalyst between the customer view and the supplier view. Roles such as
                    a requirements engineer or business analyst would be examples of this. The role could work inside the delivery teams, the
                    project management team or both. This role would be responsible for some or all of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acting as a translator, as both the customer and supplier will have their own terminology, and
                        then ensuring that both parties understand the requirements
                    </li>
                    <li>Gathering and correctly writing and defining requirements/user stories along with quality
                        criteria and acceptance criteria</li>
                    <li>Helping where appropriate by providing support with testing from the customer perspective ●●
                        Ensuring that requirements prioritization is appropriate (this includes being prepared to
                        challenge decisions where necessary)</li>
                    <li>Creating and evolving models and supporting documentation </li>
                    <li>Facilitating discussions and running workshops with the wider stakeholder community </li>
                    <li>Contributing to information held in the business case</li>
                    <li>Using techniques to ensure that requirements align with strategic and/or project objectives</li>
                    <li>Liaising with the senior user, customer SMEs and other customer stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>10.5.2.7 Getting a blended view</h4>
                <p>It is very important to represent the customer view appropriately on a PRINCE2 project. The product
                    owner is a very powerful concept but it needs to be adjusted to work in a project context. To create
                    a fully representative view of the customer at all levels and in all areas affected by a project, it
                    is important to build a blended and comprehensive view of the customer needs and perhaps involve
                    specialists to help with this, such as a requirements engineer or a business analyst. It is
                    essential to do this as well as possible as the customer will be impacted by the final product, and
                    they are ultimately justifying the investment.</p>
                <p>On a PRINCE2 project the senior user is ultimately responsible for the appropriateness of the
                    delivered product, and the executive is responsible for the justification of the project itself. The
                    product owner role as commonly defined in agile (e.g. in Scrum) operates in the best way from inside
                    the delivery teams.</p>
                <h3>10.5.3 Working agreements and team ground rules</h3>
                <p>Many concepts in agile relate to multi-skilled teams that are empowered and self-organize. Creating
                    working agreements is a concept that is used to evolve the effectiveness of a team that is
                    self-organizing. This is achieved by collectively developing a set of team guidelines, or rules, to
                    bring some structure to how the team works and behaves.</p>

                        Tip<br> Working agreements and team rules include or are similar to policies, team norms or
                        team charters.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>10.5.3.1 The basics</h4>
                <p>These agreements can operate at many levels. Some of them may relate to concepts such as values (e.g.
                    ‘we should be honest’, ‘we should be open’) whilst others may relate to simple rules about how long
                    a stand-up meeting lasts (e.g. 10 or 15 minutes), or agreeing the core working hours for the team.
                    They are created and reviewed by the team members themselves (typically during a retrospective) and
                    their purpose is to improve the effectiveness of the team by reducing mistakes and promoting
                    successful behaviours and practices.</p>
                <p>Typically they are made visible (perhaps displayed on the wall) and the team develops them over time.
                    The team manager should make sure that everyone is involved, that improvements to the rules are
                    facilitated and that everyone can contribute freely as the features evolve.</p>
                <h4>10.5.3.2 Further information</h4>
                <p>All teams are different, and most of the way a team works and acts should develop naturally and not
                    need to be defined. Therefore any rules that are defined should help strengthen the way the team
                    works and provide a focus. Having too many rules could have the opposite effect.</p>
                <h4>10.5.3.3 Hints that may prove useful</h4>
                <p>Team ground rules can help with the internal workings of the team. They could be included as part of
                    a work package as long as everyone is in agreement – i.e. the team, the project manager and the team
                    manager.</p>
                <p>Agreements and rules are potentially destructive if they are not built carefully by consensus and
                    involve all of those impacted. Some teams prefer to make their commitment to the rules visible by
                    signing them for all to see. Other teams prefer a more cautious approach based on trust and may even
                    avoid using the word ‘rule’, as they perceive this word to have negative connotations because it
                    looks like an order or a command.</p>
                <p>A balance between when to guide and when to force is needed. An example of this would be the
                    definition of ‘ready’, which is more of a guide to people, whereas the definition of ‘done’ is
                    something that should be complied with. However, both should be defined collaboratively in order to
                    get commitment to both.</p>
                <h4>10.5.3.4 The Pastor of Fun</h4>
                <p>Many in the agile community who have experience of mature agile environments put a lot of emphasis on
                    and effort into creating a collaborative culture in the teams and fostering motivated and happy
                    people. An example of this is where a team creates a role for a person called the Pastor of Fun, and
                    this role is responsible for ensuring that the team develops a close bond by organizing social
                    activities (perhaps inside and outside of work) and coming up with ideas to make certain work
                    activities or events more fun and enjoyable. This typically results in bringing out the more human
                    side of everyone, and in turn this creates behaviours such as loyalty and openness.</p>

                <h4>10.5.3.5 Assessing the needs of the team</h4>
                <p>Collectively creating agreements on how the team works can be productive, but it needs to suit the
                    requirements of the team. They should decide at what level or levels these agreements need to
                    operate and on what scale they add value. For example, a working agreement could include the
                    following parameters:</p>
                <ul><li>Everyone’s views should be listened to and respected.</li>
                    <li>The team is greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
                    <li>There is no such thing as a silly question.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to say ‘I was wrong’, ‘I need help’ or ‘I don’t know’.</li>
                    <li>Stand-ups start at exactly 9:30am.</li>
                    <li>If we can’t solve it ourselves we escalate it quickly.</li>
                    <li>Ask don’t tell.</li>
                    <li>It’s OK to challenge someone’s view.</li>
                    <li>It’s OK to have fun!</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>10.6 ORGANIZATION THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>How a PRINCE2 project is organized when in an agile context is very important. Many considerations
                    have to be taken into account in order to arrive at the best blend. One area of consideration is the
                    specific responsibilities involved with each role and how they can be mapped and tailored. However,
                    it is also important to understand and allow for the language involved, as this can have a
                    significant effect in an agile context. The exact wording or title of a role can give off a negative
                    impression in some situations, as can responsibilities that use terms such as ‘reporting to’ and
                    ‘assigned to’. It is important to ensure that PRINCE2 operates as effectively as possible and is not
                    compromised by terminology, but sometimes care is needed to create a positive effect.</p>
