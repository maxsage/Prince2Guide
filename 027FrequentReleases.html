                    <h2>27.1 PURPOSE</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this focus area is to describe the importance of frequent releases when using
                        agile. It also describes what considerations to take into account when planning releases and
                        planning the project as a whole. This focus area also addresses what to do when a release cannot
                        go directly into the operational environment. This focus area is closely linked to the Plans
                        theme (see Chapter 12) and configuration management.</p>
                    <p>A fundamental concept of any agile method or approach is to frequently deliver something of use.
                        There are many advantages associated with this such as:</p>
                    <li>It enables an early delivery of benefit to the customer.</li>
                    <li>It allows for feedback.</li>
                    <li>It is likely to reduce risk (e.g. of delivering the wrong product).</li>
                    <li>It gives confidence about how the project is proceeding through visibility and evidence.</li>
                    <li>It fosters engagement with project stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>It makes releasing easier and perhaps second nature.</li>
                    <p>The strategy for delivering frequently and how to plan for this needs careful consideration as
                        there are many trade-offs that have to be taken into account.</p>
                    <h2>27.2 RELEASING EARLY AND FREQUENTLY</h2>
                    <p>Traditionally, many projects have delivered the final product using a serial, or Waterfall,
                        approach whereby there are a series of technical phases (such as analysis, design, build, test,
                        implement) leading to the whole product being delivered at the end of the project (see Figure
                        2.2).</p>
                    <p>Even when working in this way, the project can still be broken down into chunks to allow for an
                        earlier delivery of parts of the final product. This is sometimes referred to as ‘phased
                        Waterfall’ as each chunk is still planned around technical phases. But this is still not an
                        agile way of working.</p>
                    <p>Agile looks at this in a completely different way. It does not base its plans upon technical
                        phases; it bases them on features and requirements instead. As part of the initiation stage of a
                        project PRINCE2 Agile looks at how the final product can be broken down into coherent chunks and
                        what parts of the final product can be delivered early to achieve the advantages outlined
                        previously.</p>
                    <h3>27.2.1 How releases fit in with the PRINCE2 process</h3>
                    <p>Releases can be planned using product-based planning, and individual product descriptions can
                        have their quality criteria defined to allow for different product ‘states’ (to reflect
                        releases). Release backlogs would then sit under these. An alternative to this is to avoid using
                        ‘states’ and assign products to a release backlog when appropriate. This is likely to be more
                        appropriate if there are many releases and a high degree of change as to what is going into each
                        release. It will be easier to use product-based planning this way as well.</p>
                    <p>Release planning needs to be incorporated into the PRINCE2 plans. A project plan would need to
                        clearly show how many releases were expected throughout the project, when they will take place
                        and what features are intended to be released. The same applies to a stage plan, albeit with a
                        shorter horizon (see Figure 12.3).</p>
                    <p>The different levels of plan would need to be synchronized with respect to release planning. An
                        example of this would be where the project board would like to establish a stage boundary in
                        order to manage by exception. It would need to balance out its own needs to set a timescale with
                        the needs of the customer or the delivery teams, who will have a view on what releases they
                        would like to happen and at what time.</p>
                    <p>What is being released, and when, should not be seen as a minor or incidental part of a plan. How
                        a product is released, gradually over time, will have a direct effect on how benefits are
                        realized and can have a significant effect on whether or not the project can continue to be
                        justified. It is possible that a project needs to realize early benefits in order to fund later
                        parts of the project. The project board needs to be fully aware of the significance of release
                        planning. It is not something that just concerns the people working at the delivery level.</p>
                    <p>Some of the fundamentals of the Lean Startup approach involve releasing a product in such a way
                        that it maximizes the viability of the product and enables it to fail fast if it is going to
                        fail. A well-crafted release plan can prove significantly beneficial to an organization. It can
                        create feedback that can be responded to at the earliest opportunity.</p>
                    <p>How frequently and regularly releases take place (in terms of creating a regular cadence or
                        ‘heartbeat’) needs to be collectively decided by the key stakeholders involved on the project
                        (e.g. the help desk or the training department). In some situations products and sub-products
                        can be delivered too quickly for the customer to absorb them efficiently. This could result in
                        disruption from an operational point of view.</p>
                    <h3>27.2.2 Releasing into operational use</h3>
                    <p>To benefit from all of the advantages of frequent delivery, the ideal situation is for any
                        release to go into the operational environment. However, this is not always possible or
                        desirable. If a release does not go into operational use, it is unlikely to generate any
                        benefits or ‘real’ customer feedback.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A lot depends on how much control over releasing into operational use a project has. If the
                        necessary stakeholders are on the project and they can dictate whether or not a release goes
                        into operational use, and they are responsible for the impact of the release, then this is the
                        ideal situation. This would be seen as ‘very agile’. However, if another company or department
                        is responsible for the release process and the impact a release may have, then they may have
                        other factors to consider such as contractual obligations or the needs of other stakeholders.
                        This does, to a degree, limit the agile way of working.</p>
                    <h3>27.2.3 Not releasing into operational use</h3>
                    <p>Even though feedback from real customers and some form of benefits realization would be missing,
                        there are still many advantages to delivering something into a staging area before going into
                        operational use: for example, the opportunity to assess progress and the levels of quality being
                        achieved. A significant customer demo could take place in order to receive feedback on how the
                        product is developing, along with how the project processes and team behaviours have helped with
                        that specific delivery.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately there is a significant limitation with respect to agile’s desire for regular, frequent (even
                        continual) delivery when some form of staging area is involved. Typical reasons for inclusion of a staging area
                        are regulatory compliance checking, integration testing or any other form of validation and verification
                        process. The problem is that when an error is picked up and a change needs to be made, further work may
                        have already taken place on the current state of the product, which would have been baselined at the point of
                        delivery into the staging area.</p>
                    <p>The agile way of working is compromised to a degree when this happens because the problem cannot
                        typically be solved by flexing what is being delivered. Whether or not a product is compliant
                        with a safety standard is usually a yes or no, pass or fail condition. It is unlikely that you
                        could ‘drop a little bit out of compliance’!</p>
                    <p>The problem will always remain, however, that when products are delivered into staging areas,
                        their rework will need to be accommodated and planned for in advance. This will affect
                        configuration management and version control so that the current state of the product can be
                        efficiently resynchronized back to one version.</p>
                    <h2>27.3 SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>There are significant advantages of frequently releasing products and sub-products. This is an
                        essential part of the iterative and incremental nature that differentiates agile from more
                        traditional approaches to product development. Approaches such as Kanban and Lean Startup
                        relentlessly pursue frequent delivery to the customer in as short a time as possible, in order
                        to gain these advantages. The ultimate goal is to release continually if conditions allow and
                        the benefits of doing so are realized.</p>
