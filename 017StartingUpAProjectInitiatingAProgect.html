                    <h2>17.1 PRINCE2 GUIDANCE ON STARTING UP A PROJECT AND INITIATING A PROJECT</h2>
                    <h3>17.1.1 Starting up a Project</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of the Starting up a Project process is to ensure that the prerequisites for
                        Initiating a Project are in place by answering the question ‘Do we have a viable and worthwhile
                        project?’</p>
                    <p>It is as much about preventing poorly conceived projects from being initiated as it is about
                        approving the initiation of viable projects. As such, the Starting up a Project process is a
                        lighter task compared to the more detailed and thorough Initiating a Project process. The aim is
                        to do the minimum necessary in order to decide whether it is worthwhile to even initiate the
                        project (see Figure 17.1 for an overview).</p>
                    <h3>17.1.2 Initiating a Project</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of the Initiating a Project process is to establish solid foundations for the
                        project, enabling the organization to understand the work that needs to be done to deliver the
                        project’s products before committing to a significant spend.</p>
                    <p>Initiating a Project is aimed at laying down the foundations in order to achieve a successful
                        project. Specifically, all parties must be clear on what the project is intended to achieve, why
                        it is needed, how the outcome is to be achieved and what their responsibilities are, so that
                        there can be genuine commitment to it.</p>
                    <p>The Initiating a Project process allows the project board, via Directing a Project, to decide
                        whether or not the project is sufficiently aligned with corporate or programme objectives to
                        authorize its continuation.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure17-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />

                    </figure>
                    <p>If, instead, the organization proceeds directly from Starting up a Project to Controlling a
                        Stage, then it may be forced to commit significant financial resources to a project without
                        fully understanding how its objectives will be achieved. Without a firm definition, the project
                        board will be taking a leap of faith.</p>
                    <p>All activities within the Initiating a Project process need further consideration if the
                        relationship between the customer and the supplier is a commercial one (for example, the reasons
                        for undertaking the project as defined in the supplier’s business case may be different from
                        those defined in the customer’s business case).</p>
                    <p>During the Initiating a Project process the project manager will be creating the suite of
                        management products required for the level of control specified by the project board. The
                        project manager should have agreed (as part of the initiation stage plan) the means by which the
                        project board will review and approve the management products – the two extremes are one at a
                        time or all at once (see Figure 17.2 for an overview).</p>
                    <p>Please note that Starting up a Project and Initiating a Project are separate processes in
                        PRINCE2, but they have been combined into the same chapter in this manual as the guidance when
                        using PRINCE2 with agile is the same for both processes because they both relate to getting a
                        project off to a good start. It is important to note that this does not mean that they are
                        combined into one step when using PRINCE2 Agile. They should be used as two distinct processes
                        as with PRINCE2.</p>

                    <h2>17.2 AGILE WAYS OF WORKING THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST</h2>
                    <p>The most common agile approaches focus on product delivery and therefore they do not have
                        processes beforehand to formally define any upfront work. Some agile approaches such as DSDM,
                        DAD and FDD (see Table 2.1) do acknowledge the need to do this work; however, there is little
                        standardization in this area across the agile community.</p>
                    <p>In simple terms this is usually for one of two reasons. Either the agile approach assumes that
                        the upfront work would have already taken place, or it does not need it to be done.</p>
                    <p>Mature agile organizations using agile build their own processes for upfront work when they use
                        agile in a project context.</p>
                    <p>Two concepts that occur quite frequently in agile are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project chartering or visioning</li>
                        <li>Sprint zero (iteration zero or (the) discovery (phase)) – see section 9.2.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Project chartering or visioning in agile is typically used to gain a basic understanding of the
                        project and is seen as a short process where information is captured and recorded in a very
                        simple form often using bullet points and visualization.</p>
                    <p>Sprint zero is a similar idea widely used by Scrum and agile teams but the concept is
                        controversial in that it is seen by some as unnecessary and is not part of the Scrum Guide.</p>
                    <p>The amount of upfront work that takes place in an agile context is often a question of balancing
                        the need to do some planning with the desire to let things emerge and use empiricism in order to
                        adapt to changing circumstances. In a BAU context doing very little planning can be a very
                        effective philosophy but in a project context where work will be more challenging this could be
                        too risky.</p>
                    <p>A lot of guidance in agile starts with a backlog of features to build but in a project context
                        this will need to be created.</p>
                    <h2>17.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE ON STARTING UP A PROJECT AND INITIATING A PROJECT</h2>
                    <p>In PRINCE2 it is important that a project gets off to a good start with the appropriate amount of
                        upfront work. Not only that but this upfront work is typically broken down into two parts. Most
                        upfront work done in some agile environments only concerns getting ready for delivery. PRINCE2
                        provides more rigour to this work by putting more structure around what ‘being ready’ means
                        (during Initiating a Project), and also making sure it is worth getting ready in the first place
                        (during Starting up a Project).</p>
                    <p>Upfront work can be regarded as unnecessary to a degree by some in the agile community as it is
                        seen as being ‘predictive’ and not ‘emergent’. PRINCE2 is predictive to a degree but can be very
                        emergent if required (e.g. by reducing the length and formality of the initiation stage).
                        However, any PRINCE2 project needs to be justified and has to be viable from the start.
                        Fundamentally, part of this upfront work must answer the ‘why?’ question in the form of a
                        business case (i.e. Why are we doing this project?). One important reason for knowing this is so
                        that the project manager (and perhaps anyone involved on the project) can tell when it needs to
                        be stopped before the planned end date.</p>

                            Definition: Disruptive<br>
                            A widely used term that has more than one definition but in general terms refers to
                            situations where there are high degrees of uncertainty (e.g. with product innovation) and
                            the product being developed will significantly disrupt (intentionally or accidentally) the
                            existing environment or marketplace (e.g. 3D printing).
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Lean Startup is often cited as demonstrating how agile can work when faced with high levels of
                        uncertainty, and there are parallels between growing a small company (often using ‘disruptive’
                        technologies) and running a challenging project in that even dynamic ground-breaking start-ups
                        need to justify coming into existence to investors and need to be held to account at funding
                        reviews from time to time.</p>
                    <p>Collecting enough information means that a lot of areas need to be looked at because they can all
                        impact the business case in one form or another (e.g. risks, organizational structure, quality
                        planning, communication planning and how the project is tailored).</p>
                    <p>How this information is presented depends on the needs of the project and the project board.
                        Typically this may be in a document but it could be delivered along with a face-to-face
                        presentation. Alternatively, most, if not all, of this information could be visible on the walls
                        of a team room using lots of visualization.</p>
                    <p>As part of these two processes (Starting up a Project and Initiating a Project), the suitability
                        of using agile needs to be assessed. The use of agile will bring many advantages but it will
                        also bring with it a set of risks if agile is used inappropriately. This is assessed using the
                        Agilometer (see Chapter 24).</p>
                    <h3>17.3.1 Further guidance that may also be appropriate</h3>
                    <p>The project product description (and the business case) should be defined with more focus on how
                        the output can be described so that the outcomes and benefits can be adjusted during the
                        project. If the project product description just focuses on the intended solution then the
                        supplier is more likely to focus on this than the value it intends to deliver. This in turn may
                        impact contractual arrangements made before delivery commences (e.g. how much the style will
                        reflect the agile way of working).</p>
                    <p>The high-level and intermediate-level requirements are likely to be held as a list which may take
                        the form of a spreadsheet or a low-tech list on a wall and may be referred to as a backlog.|</p>
                    <p>An early definition of ‘done’ is likely to be part of the quality management strategy or an
                        existing one that has been used from a previous project.</p>
                    <p>The mapping of existing agile roles to the PRINCE2 roles will be defined and understood (e.g. how
                        the team manager role will be fulfilled).</p>
                    <p>Understanding is required of agile terminology such as project chartering, discovery phase,
                        visioning, sprint zero and product roadmaps.</p>
                    <p>Agile suitability needs to be assessed by looking at what agile ways of working exist or need to
                        exist, and what are their respective advantages and disadvantages (e.g. is co-locating the team
                        a good idea or will it be too expensive and undermine the business case?)</p>
                    <p>Workshops are likely to be used to collaboratively create and understand deliverables.</p>
                    <p>Levels of uncertainty need to be explicitly stated as these may affect the choice of agile
                        techniques such as the use of prototyping, spikes or experiments and the choice of how long to
                        make timeboxes. Sometimes a project may be taking place in a very volatile context or where
                        there are vague requirements. At other times the context could be more stable and there is less
                        need for prototypes, spikes and experiments.</p>
                    <p>The level of formality will be decided with respect to such things as control, communication and
                        planning (e.g. how will progress be tracked – on a wall or using a tool?).</p>
                    <p>If there are high levels of uncertainty then this phase is likely to be very short.</p>
                    <p>The impact of frequent releases should be assessed with respect to areas such as how quality will
                        be managed and how the frequent delivery of products (or products in differing states) will take
                        place (e.g. whether they will always go directly into operational use).</p>

                    <h3>17.4.1 The Cynefin framework</h3>
                    <p>The Cynefin framework (pronounced kuh-nev-in) was created by David Snowden. It is a
                        decision-making framework that has been designed to help with understanding and determining what
                        level of complexity exists in a given situation or environment.</p>
                    <p>In the context of PRINCE2 Agile this can be used to help understand the level of complexity
                        facing a project or potential project.</p>
                    <h4>17.4.1.1 The five domains</h4>
                    <p>The Cynefin framework identifies five domains which describe the relationship between ‘cause’ and
                        ‘effect’ of events and interactions, and therefore determines how complex an environment is. In
                        simple terms, if x happens and results in y, what is the relationship between x and y? Is it to
                        be expected and always happens, or could it be completely unexpected and in fact random?</p>
                    <p>The five relationships are identified as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Obvious Where the relationship is obvious and is usually addressed by ‘best practice’</li>
                        <li>Complicated Where some form of analysis or expertise is required to understand the
                            relationship, which is usually addressed by ‘good practice’ where there may be several
                            different options available</li>
                        <li>Complex Where the relationship can only be understood in retrospect and is addressed by
                            ‘emergent practice’ which may evolve to a new way of working
                        </li>
                        <li>Chaotic Where there is no apparent relationship, and any way of working is described as
                            novel
                        </li>
                        <li>Disorder Where the relationship is unknown.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Cynefin framework is shown in Figure 17.3. The central area of the figure represents the
                        fifth domain of ‘disorder’. The boundary between ‘obvious’ and ‘chaotic’ is, in fact, a ‘cliff’.
                        To transition between these two domains is regarded as potentially catastrophic, whereas
                        transitioning across any of the other boundaries is not.</p>

                    <h4>17.4.1.2 When to use Cynefin and what to use it for</h4>
                    <p>During Starting up a Project and Initiating a Project this framework can be used to understand
                        (or attempt to understand), the complexity of a project. The framework can be used to analyse
                        two areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The level of complexity of the final product in terms of the output, outcome and benefits
                            (e.g. whether it is highly innovative and there is little knowledge of how well it will
                            sell)
                        </li>
                        <li>The level of complexity of the project environment in terms of such things as the levels of
                            co-location, collaboration and experience (e.g. there are many teams involved from all
                            around the world).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>17.4.1.3 Assessing the level of complexity</h4>
                    <p>Correctly assessing the level of complexity of the product and the project environment can help
                        to determine the appropriate use of PRINCE2 and agile. It can be the case that certain areas of
                        a project have different levels of complexity (e.g. the user interface of a control panel may be
                        highly volatile and difficult to design, whereas the internal mechanics may be reasonably
                        straightforward).</p>
                    <h4>17.4.1.4 An example of a complex or chaotic situation</h4>
                    <p>If the output from a project is a highly innovative children’s toy that is very different from
                        anything currently in the marketplace then approaches such as Lean Startup (where strong
                        emphasis is placed on learning quickly) and techniques such as spiking and prototyping are
                        likely to be appropriate at the delivery level.</p>
                    <p>Making the PRINCE2 processes as short as possible and using many stages may also be appropriate
                        and the project could feel very much like an experiment, or a series of experiments.</p>
                    <h4>17.4.1.5 An example of a complicated situation</h4>
                    <p>As an alternative to the previous example, if the same organization was creating a new board game
                        for adults and it had done this many times before, it may use four-weekly timeboxes to execute
                        the delivery and may have very few stage boundaries.</p>
                    <p>In the second example it may even be the case that the level of complexity does not warrant the
                        use of PRINCE2 and the work should be carried out as BAU.</p>
                    <p>The Cynefin framework should not be used as a categorization tool, as one of the principles
                        behind it is that people have a natural tendency to categorize complexity according to their own
                        experiences and preferences. A person who is used to working in the complicated domain may well
                        have a tendency to approach a problem by analysing it, whereas a different person who is used to
                        working in the complex domain may approach the same problem by running an experiment.</p>
                    <p>If the level of complexity is assessed collaboratively there is more likelihood that it will be
                        correctly determined and PRINCE2 will be configured appropriately.</p>
                    <p>When a project is in progress it is possible that the level of complexity of the project, or the
                        product, may change and migrate across the domain boundaries. PRINCE2 and the agile approaches
                        being used may then need to be tuned (e.g. timebox durations may need to be shortened or
                        lengthened; more customer demos may be required).</p>
                    <h4>17.4.1.6 Evolving PRINCE2 in an agile context with Cynefin</h4>
                    <p>The Cynefin framework can also be used to apply the learnings from a project to other projects
                        and evolve the use of PRINCE2 and agile as a whole throughout an organization. A project
                        framework may typically exist in the complicated domain (‘good practice’) but that is a matter
                        of choice for an organization as it may be more beneficial to see it in the complex domain
                        (‘emergent practice’). One approach would be to assign different areas of the project framework
                        to their most appropriate domain (e.g. some innovative agile techniques that may be unproven may
                        be used when in the chaotic domain).</p>
                    <p>One specific area the Cynefin framework focuses on is the area of complacency which exists
                        between the obvious and the chaotic domains (referred to earlier as the cliff). An example of
                        this would be where the use of PRINCE2 Agile becomes robotic and routine through it being
                        applied inappropriately and not being adapted to suit the environment or the level of
                        uncertainty. Perhaps it has become stale as it only exists in the obvious domain and therefore
                        does not change or evolve and is regarded as a simple thing to do. This can lead to what Cynefin
                        describes as a crisis or catastrophe, where a sudden realization occurs that an approach is no
                        longer fit for purpose (e.g. a major project disaster occurs because the underlying process is
                        no longer appropriate).</p>
                    <h2>17.5 SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>A distinguishing feature of PRINCE2 is that a project needs to be set up and started in a
                        controlled and appropriate manner in order to increase the chance of project success.</p>
                    <p>Ideally when using PRINCE2 in an agile context the processes of Starting up a Project and
                        Initiating a Project would involve lots of interaction between the relevant stakeholders. The
                        use of workshops and the visual capture of key information to identify the benefits, outcomes
                        and outputs for the project would be prevalent.</p>
                    <p>The use of agile would be appropriate to the environment and the level of uncertainty.
                        Prioritized requirements would be clearly defined in measurable terms, not in too much detail
                        and understood by all. Along with this a strategy for how the level of quality will be achieved
                        and a plan for how the project will be executed will be created and agreed before delivery
                        commences.</p>
                    <p>This will create the right conditions for a project so that it can be run as effectively as
                        possible by starting at the right time when just enough information has been collected in order
                        to appropriately authorize delivery to commence.</p>
