                    <h2>14.1 THE PRINCE2 APPROACH TO THE CHANGE THEME</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of the Change theme is to identify, assess and control any potential and approved
                        changes to the baseline.</p>
                    <p>Change is inevitable during the life of a project and every project needs a systemic approach to
                        the identification, assessment and control of issues that may result in change.</p>
                    <p>Issue and change control is a continual activity, performed throughout the life of the project.
                        Without an ongoing and effective issue and change control procedure, a project will either
                        become unresponsive to its stakeholders or drift out of control.</p>
                    <h2>14.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE CHANGE THEME</h2>
                    <p>Agile embraces change. One of the four values of the Agile Manifesto is about ‘responding to
                        change’ and one of its principles is ‘welcoming changing requirements, even late in
                        development’.</p>
                    <p>Agile sees change as inevitable and a normal situation. The understanding of a project will
                        change as the project proceeds: ‘unknowns’ will surface and unexpected events will happen.
                        Responding positively to change when it happens results in a more accurate product being
                        delivered, and because agile puts a lot of emphasis on flexing what is being delivered, this is
                        where most of the change is managed and is the focus of PRINCE2 Agile.</p>
                    <h3>14.2.1 Changes to what is being delivered</h3>
                    <p>Changes to the detailed understanding of the product being created would typically be viewed in a
                        positive light, as this greater understanding improves what is being produced. However, if the
                        changes mean that the baseline upon which the work was justified is being compromised, then this
                        may not be seen in a positive light, as it may be a symptom of significant misunderstandings
                        from earlier on in the project. One caveat to the idea of baseline change perhaps being
                        unwelcome is that in a wider context it may be positive news – in the sense that it results in
                        the fast failure of the project that would ultimately have delivered an unsuccessful outcome.
                        This could represent good news in general, but perhaps not good news for that particular
                        project.</p>
                    <p>In simple terms these different types of change to what is being delivered can be described as
                        detail or baseline changes (see Figure 14.1).</p>
                    <h3>14.2.2 Other types of change</h3>
                    <p>Agile usually refers to change as something that affects a project’s products. PRINCE2 sees
                        anything that affects the agreed baseline as change and handles it accordingly. If a team member
                        becomes ill and will be unavailable for two weeks, then this would be handled as a change in the
                        form of an issue as it will impact planning. A typical agile response to this (assuming the team
                        was of sufficient size) would be for the delivery team to re-organize and aim to deliver less
                        due to the reduced capacity, although this would depend on the level of collaboration with the
                        customer</p>

                        <figcaption>Fig 14-001 Requirements change can happen to the baseline or to the detail</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h2>14.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE FOR THE CHANGE THEME</h2>
                    <p>Both PRINCE2 and agile see change as inevitable but there is a contrast between the two in that
                        agile embraces change and could be described as ‘change friendly’, whereas PRINCE2 is somewhat
                        more cautious and could be said to ‘control it’. These views are not contradictory, and when
                        combining PRINCE2 with agile it creates a blend of controlling significant change, whilst giving
                        freedom to allow for responsive change at the detail level.</p>
                    <p>This means allowing change at the product delivery level in order to harness the benefits of
                        positive change, whilst at the same time putting in place the appropriate governance to handle
                        change, which may affect the agreed baseline upon which the project was justified. Techniques
                        for handling change are described in section 14.4.</p>
                    <p>One particular area of note when handling change is to assess if the change has any impact on the
                        ability to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) at the right time, as this will immediately
                        raise an exception.</p>
                    <h3>14.3.1 Allowing for change</h3>
                    <p>During pre-project and the initiation stage, PRINCE2 creates plans and product descriptions that
                        form baseline definitions of what is to be delivered. To enable a more agile way of working,
                        these baseline definitions should allow enough room for manoeuvre by being defined at the right
                        level, to cater for the inevitability of change whilst at the same time providing enough clarity
                        to ensure that the justification for the project is still sound.</p>
                    <p>When setting this baseline, using the correct level of detail is important in an agile context,
                        as per the following examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a high degree of accuracy is needed When making a mirror or a lens for a telescope used
                            in space, a deviation by a single micrometre may have a seriously damaging effect on its
                            effectiveness.
                        </li>
                        <li>When a lesser degree of accuracy is needed The operating temperature for radio equipment
                            used by a soldier may be best specified by a range which can be prioritized (‘must’ work at
                            –10°C, ‘should’ work at –20°C, ‘could’ work at –30°C).
                        </li></ul>
                    <p>The examples illustrate that sometimes requirements definition is like a binary condition in that
                        it is either exactly right or it is not, whereas at other times it is more of a spectrum in that
                        there is a varying degree of correctness. When defining requirements, it is important to avoid
                        defining those requirements that have varying degrees of correctness in a binary form. Doing so
                        reduces the options available if adjustments to the scope, or a product’s quality criteria,
                        become necessary later in the project thus reducing the ability to work in an agile way.</p>
                    <p>Further refinement of these products happens during Managing a Stage Boundary and Managing
                        Product Delivery, but this should not affect the baseline described in the project initiation
                        documentation.</p>
                    <h3>14.3.2 Relationships between the Change theme, the Risk theme and configuration management</h3>
                    <p>In order to be more proactive about change in an agile setting, as well as controlled and
                        consistent after responding to change, it should be noted that in PRINCE2 there is a close
                        relationship between the Change theme, the Risk theme and the activity of configuration
                        management. In this way a good risk management strategy and good risk management can lessen the
                        impact of change by formally allowing for it and planning for it. A good configuration
                        management strategy and good configuration management will then ensure that changes have been
                        applied correctly and consistently. Whether or not this only happens at the higher levels of the
                        project structure depends on where the baseline has been set and whether or not it impacts the
                        teams working at the delivery level.</p>
                    <h3>14.3.3 Delegation of decision-making</h3>
                    <p>It is very important to deal with change at the appropriate level of management. PRINCE2
                        establishes many controls that can be used but they should be used at the right level and at the
                        right time. The most prominent of these controls are the tolerances in the product descriptions
                        and the work packages.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, an empowered self-organizing team working at the delivery level should be
                        free to handle change quite dynamically as long as that change is at the detailed level and is
                        within defined tolerances. This is where specifying the quality criteria for a product
                        description as a range or spectrum can prove beneficial. Any significant change that may impact
                        baselines set at the stage or project level may need to be escalated to the project board or to
                        a change authority if one has been set up.</p>
                    <p>In either situation it is useful to track the type of change – for example, is it an
                        off-specification that the supplier needs to rectify or is it a request for change that the
                        customer has raised? This can be useful for learning lessons from the project in terms of where
                        these changes originated; they may also be relevant in contractual terms depending on how the
                        contract was created (see Chapter 28 for a description of an agile style of contract).</p>
                    <p>It is important when establishing controls to handle change that they create an environment which
                        enables quick and accurate change when the change has a positive effect on the project, whilst
                        at the same time protecting the project from change that may have a more unwelcome impact.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 has a clearly defined issue and change control procedure; for a baseline change this
                        needs to be carried out as quickly as possible, although it may take several days. For a detail
                        change the same process is used but it may take seconds: a quick discussion, a decision on what
                        to de-scope or which priorities to change, and the procedure is complete. This is how an
                        empowered delivery team should work.</p>
                    <h2>14.4 AGILE CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
                    <h3>14.4.1 The feedback loop</h3>
                    <p>A fundamental concept in agile is to gather feedback from a customer as quickly as possible. This
                        is in keeping with the PRINCE2 Agile behaviour of exploration. This takes the form of a cycle
                        where something is delivered, gets used, creates feedback (which can be in many forms) and then
                        drives further decisions and deliveries (see Figure 14.2).</p>
                    <p>Lean Startup puts particular focus on this and aims to make this cycle as short as possible in
                        order to become more responsive. It refers to this as ‘accelerating the feedback loop’. How
                        short a timescale this feedback loop will be varies considerably between different organizations
                        in different sectors, but the aim is to move from months to weeks, weeks to days and even days
                        to hours. Sprint reviews and release reviews are examples of where this feedback can be
                        collected.</p>
                    <p>Ideally, this feedback should be as ‘true’ as possible and involve the end customer. Having said
                        that, any feedback about the project process or the product being created is going to have
                        value. The ultimate goal is to have real customer feedback in as short a time as possible: this
                        may require continual customer involvement. The feedback loop is of great importance to being
                        truly agile. A lot of emphasis on effort should be channelled into making this as short and
                        effective as possible.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Other forms of feedback loop exist such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OODA (Observe, Orient(ate), Decide, Act)</li>
                        <li>PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act)</li>
                        <li>PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act)</li>
                        <li>Build, measure, learn (Lean Startup).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>14.5 CHANGE THEME SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>Change will happen, and the combination of PRINCE2 and agile in this area typifies the marriage
                        of these two. A project increases its chances of success if it can be responsive at the detail
                        level (e.g. by flexing or trading detailed requirements) and remain in control at the higher
                        levels (e.g. by ensuring that the business case is still viable at the end of a stage).</p>
                    <p>The processes for Starting up a Project and Initiating a Project also help to create an
                        environment where change can happen, and be responded to, at the correct level and at the
                        correct point in a project. Many projects are poorly started and this results in change
                        happening due to the incorrect level of detail being defined. If there are too many detailed
                        requirements during the pre-project stage, they are unlikely to have been understood correctly.
                        Equally, a project could be in the initiation stage with only a few high-level requirements
                        defined and important decisions being made that are not based on enough information.</p>
                    <p>Successful projects need to handle change easily, and with PRINCE2 ensuring that the wider
                        project context is under control, many of the agile behaviours, concepts, frameworks and
                        techniques such as prioritization, timeboxing, exploration and collaboration can play their part
                        in embracing change and delivering the best possible solution for the customer.</p>
