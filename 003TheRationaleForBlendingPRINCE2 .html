                <h1>3 The rationale for blending PRINCE2 and agile</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>PRINCE2 is the most commonly used project management approach in the world, and it is increasingly
                    being used in conjunction with agile. As more organizations adopt agile, the need for specific
                    guidance on how to use PRINCE2 in an agile context has grown accordingly.</p>
                <p>In simple terms, PRINCE2 and agile each have their own strengths and when combined they complement
                    each other and create a holistic approach to managing projects in an agile way.</p>
                <p>The strength of PRINCE2 lies in the areas of project direction and project management. However, it
                    provides little focus on the field of product delivery.</p>
                <p>Conversely, agile has a very strong focus on product delivery but relatively little on project
                    direction and project management (see Figure 3.1).</p>
                <p>Therefore, when PRINCE2 and agile are combined, all three areas in Figure 3.1 are addressed. It is
                    essential to see this combination as a blend and a mixture as opposed to PRINCE2 and agile working
                    in parallel. Those directing and managing a project in an agile context need to adopt agile
                    disciplines and behaviours. Equally, those using agile to deliver need to integrate seamlessly with
                    the PRINCE2 ethos of staying in control by empowering people and ensuring that the project remains
                    viable.</p>

                    <figcaption>Fig 03-001 Blending PRINCE2 and agile together</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Historically, the majority of the applications of agile related to ongoing product development, and
                    this would typically be in an IT context. However, the use of agile has now gone beyond IT and is
                    being used in more challenging situations. Therefore, as the need for agile to work in a project
                    context increases, the established and internationally recognized methods for project management
                    have needed to provide guidance on how they work with agile.</p>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile provides guidance for tailoring PRINCE2 to work in the most effective way in an agile
                    context.</p>
                <h2>3.1 WHO IS PRINCE2 AGILE FOR?</h2>
                <p>The primary purpose of this guidance is to help and support the existing PRINCE2 community and in
                    particular PRINCE2 practitioners. Anyone directing or managing a PRINCE2 project who is using agile
                    will benefit from this guidance. Anyone involved with, or impacted by, a PRINCE2 project that is
                    using agile will also benefit from this guidance (e.g. project support, quality assurance).
                    Organizations and individuals outside the PRINCE2 community can also benefit from this guidance in
                    one of the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Those who currently have experience with agile may want to become familiar with, and perhaps
                        ultimately adopt, an internationally recognized standard for project management along with their
                        existing agile capability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Those who are relatively new to agile may want to become familiar with, and perhaps ultimately
                        adopt, an internationally recognized standard for project management as they evolve their agile
                        capability.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile is not a substitute for PRINCE2. However, for those outside the PRINCE2 community,
                    PRINCE2 Agile may provide additional guidance to help them adopt PRINCE2 for all of their projects,
                    irrespective of whether or not they involve agile.</p>
                <h2>3.2 WHICH COMMUNITIES WILL BENEFIT FROM PRINCE2 AGILE?</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile is aimed at the communities shown in Table 3.1.</p>

                <p>Table 3.3 outlines the most appropriate course of action that the communities listed in Table 3.1
                    would need to take in terms of using PRINCE2 Agile, when faced with the situations described in
                    Table 3.2.</p>
                <h2>3.5 WHAT DOES PRINCE2 AGILE CONSIST OF?</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 comprises an integrated set of principles, themes and processes that are tailored to the
                    specific needs of a project (see Figure 3.2).</p>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile provides guidance on tailoring PRINCE2 in an agile context and covers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to tailor the principles, themes and processes</li>
                    <li>How to produce the PRINCE2 management products</li>
                    <li>How to map the common agile roles to the PRINCE2 project management team structure</li>
                    <li>How to incorporate the fundamental agile behaviours, concepts and techniques into PRINCE2
                    </li>
                    <li>What areas are of particular significance when using agile and need specific focus.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This applies to all levels of a PRINCE2 project – i.e. project direction, project management and
                    product delivery.</p>
                <p>Agile encapsulates a wide collection of frameworks, and PRINCE2 Agile incorporates and references
                    several of them. A few of these methods and approaches receive particular attention in PRINCE2 Agile
                    because they are seen as very popular or good practice. They are Scrum, Kanban and Lean Startup (see

                <h2>3.6 IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT PRINCE2 AGILE AND THIS MANUAL</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 has been used and implemented in a wide variety of situations and has evolved significantly
                    since it was first published in 1996. Agile has had a similar journey, but also comes in many
                    different forms.</p>
                <p>In order to correctly understand PRINCE2 Agile and this manual, the reader must be aware of the
                    following eight guidance points which are intended to provide clarity where there is potential for
                    ambiguity, and accuracy where there may be misconceptions. These points are summarized in Table 3.4
                    for quick reference.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>All references to PRINCE2 refer to the edition created in 2009 (Managing Successful Projects
                        with PRINCE2). This version is already enabled to work with agile; it just needs to be tailored
                        to suit any given project. Configuring PRINCE2 in the most effective way for agile is a matter
                        of where to put emphasis and where to add further levels of detailed guidance. Nothing needs to
                        be removed or significantly changed, as this is achieved through blending agile into PRINCE2 and
                        tuning PRINCE2 appropriately.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRINCE2 allows for any style of working, such as with environments that involve high levels of
                        informality, collaboration and trust. It should be understood that PRINCE2 should not be thought
                        of as a ‘traditional project management approach’ in the stereotypical sense of being
                        predominantly ‘Waterfall’, ‘big design up front’, ‘bureaucratic’ and using a ‘command and
                        control’ culture. PRINCE2 does not suggest that a project should be run in this way, and much of
                        its guidance is to the contrary.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most of the heritage and thinking behind agile has come from IT and software development, but
                        PRINCE2 Agile does not assume an IT context – although it can be used in an IT context, it is
                        not an IT framework or an IT method.
                    </li>
                    <li>Many agile approaches and frameworks are created solely for IT situations – for example, eXtreme
                        Programming (XP) and the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). PRINCE2 Agile will only make passing
                        reference to IT-only frameworks (see Table 2.1 for brief descriptions).
                    </li>
                    <li>The most well-known agile framework is Scrum, and PRINCE2 Agile is written with the view that
                        although Scrum can rightly be described as being ‘agile’, the converse is not the case: it is
                        not true to describe agile as ‘using the Scrum framework’. Other frameworks exist and a
                        framework is only part of the agile way of working.
                    </li>
                    <li>Although agile appears in many forms, the use of the Scrum framework and (to a lesser extent)
                        the Kanban framework (either separately or in combination) make up the vast majority of what
                        agile practitioners use. There are many other frameworks and approaches but when this manual
                        uses expressions such as ‘commonly used in agile’ or ‘widely used in agile’ it will usually be
                        referring to either of these two frameworks. It is important to note that Scrum and Kanban are
                        not project management frameworks, and a project manager role is not defined in either. On their
                        own, and in isolation, they cannot be used to manage a project. They can, however, be used on a
                        project as part of an approach to delivering products, as long as they are contained within a
                        wider project management framework such as PRINCE2.
                    </li>
                    <li>The term ‘agile’ when used on its own in this manual refers to a general family of behaviours,
                        concepts, frameworks and techniques that is widely accepted throughout the agile community as
                        being part of the agile way of working. The terms ‘behaviours, concepts, frameworks, and
                        techniques’ also encapsulate other similar terms such as methods, principles, values, mind-sets
                        and approaches.
                    </li>
                    <li>PRINCE2 Agile does not see working in an agile way as a binary condition (i.e. you either are or
                        you are not working in an agile way). It always sees agile as a question of how much (or how
                        little) it can be used according to the situation that exists. To illustrate this point, PRINCE2
                        Agile does not refer to ‘agile projects’ as this would infer that some projects are agile,
                        whereas others are not. PRINCE2 Agile is written with the view that agile behaviours, concepts,
                        frameworks and techniques can be applied to any project.

                <h2>3.7 BEWARE OF PREJUDICE!</h2>
                <p>It would be understandable to think that bringing more control and governance into the agile domain
                    could prove counter-productive. However, PRINCE2 Agile represents a marriage that is based on the
                    opposite view – that control and governance allow agile to be used in more situations such as those
                    involving multiple teams or complex environments.</p>
                <p>A fighter aircraft is built with a deliberately unstable airframe. This instability gives it agility
                    and allows it to change direction easily and adapt quickly to situations. However, to do this still
                    requires control and governance! This personifies PRINCE2 Agile.</p>
