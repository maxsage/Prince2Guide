                <h2>7.1 THE PRINCE2 PRINCIPLES</h2>
                <p>The principles on which PRINCE2 is based originate from lessons learned from projects both good and
                    bad. They provide a framework of good practice for those people involved in a project. If a project
                    does not adhere to these principles, it is not being managed using PRINCE2, because the principles
                    are the basis of what defines a PRINCE2 project.</p>
                <p>The seven PRINCE2 principles are listed in section 5.2.</p>
                <p>It is the adoption of these principles that characterizes whether a project is using PRINCE2, not the
                    adoption of processes and documents alone. The principles facilitate good use of PRINCE2 by ensuring
                    that the method is not applied in an overly prescriptive way or in name only, but applied in a way
                    that is sufficient to contribute to the success of the project.</p>
                <h2>7.2 THE GENERAL VIEW OF AGILE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRINCE2 PRINCIPLES</h2>
                <p>Agile has a very strong focus on such things as principles. The Agile Manifesto and the agile
                    frameworks and methods (see Appendix E) all promote a set of principles in some form, although the
                    exact wording used to describe the fundamental mind-set, attitudes and ethos does vary and includes
                    or is sometimes replaced by such terms as ‘values’, ‘behaviours’ and ‘philosophy’.</p>
                <p>PRINCE2 principles do not conflict with any of the agile principles. They are complementary to the
                    agile way of working. Some of the PRINCE2 principles could be described as ‘very much agile’ such as
                    continued business justification, learn from experience, focus on products and manage by exception –
                    the latter being synonymous with giving people autonomy and empowerment.</p>
                <h2>7.3 GUIDANCE ON APPLYING THE PRINCE2 PRINCIPLES</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 is principles-based and all seven of the principles are applicable when combining PRINCE2
                    with agile. Table 7.1 provides an overview of the guidance when applying the principles and some
                    further considerations to bear in mind.</p>

                            attention should be paid to it throughout the project by the project management team (for
                            more information, see the Business Case theme covered in Chapter 9, and also section

                            working with respect to the project environment (e.g. How engaged is the customer? How easy

                            customer involvement by using another person from another team during the missing weeks and
                            creating a handover log to be updated throughout this period.

                <h2>7.4 PRINCE2 AGILE BEHAVIOURS</h2>
                <p>When tailoring PRINCE2 to work in an agile context a PRINCE2 project manager and the project board
                    will need to monitor specific behaviours from the project management team and the delivery teams.
                    These behaviours need to function smoothly for agile to operate in the most effective way. As shown
                    in Figure 7.1, they are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparency</li>
                    <li>Collaboration</li>
                    <li>Rich communication</li>
                    <li>Self-organization</li>
                    <li>Exploration</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>7.4.1 Transparency</h3>
                <p>The more information that is out in the open, the better this is for the agile way of working. It
                    enables speed, clarity and engagement, even if the news is not so good.</p>
                <p>Essential to understanding this behaviour is to realize that there is more to transparency than just
                    visibility. The most important elements of this principle come in the form of the common agile
                    values of honesty, trust, integrity and respect. This openness is an essential ingredient for an
                    agile way of working.</p>
                <p>Take a situation, for example, where it is decided to show the progress of a three-month stage as a
                    burndown chart on the wall of the office. As each day passes the gap between the actual rate of
                    progress and the planned rate keeps widening. The project team is aware of the situation and every
                    day the team looks to close the gap by addressing the reasons for being behind (e.g. Is it extra
                    work? Are the estimates too low?). Transparency means that everyone knows the situation and there
                    are no surprises.</p>
                <h3>7.4.2 Collaboration</h3>
                <p>A motivated and respectful team is greater than the sum of its parts if people work together and
                    provide cover for one another. More can be achieved this way than working in silos. Collaboration is
                    not just internal to the team: it involves external collaboration with all stakeholders, especially
                    the customer. Fully engaging with customers and working with them, rather than for them, will create
                    shared understanding and ownership of goals and outputs.</p>
                <p>An example of collaboration could be where a team is falling behind with work due to one person
                    having difficulties with a technical problem. One person on the team is ahead of schedule on their
                    own work, so they stop to help the colleague. The same thing happened in the previous sprint,
                    although the roles on that occasion were reversed.</p>
                <h3>7.4.3 Rich communication</h3>
                <p>People should always use the most effective channel to communicate. Using face-to-face and/or
                    visualization are many times faster and more effective than words on their own. A rich communication
                    environment should be created where information passes freely in a culture of commitment and trust.
                    There is still a need for documentation, but by using other more effective channels, it can be
                    replaced or complemented and greatly reduced.</p>
                <p>An example of rich communication is provided where an email thread has been circulating between three
                    team members for over an hour about a possible design change. One of the team members decides to get
                    the other two over to a whiteboard and discuss the point face-to-face. They agree a way forward in a
                    matter of minutes.</p>
                <h3>7.4.4 Self-organization</h3>
                <p>The people closest to the work will usually know best how to get the job done. Therefore people
                    should be trusted to do it. If they create a plan, then they own it and buy into it; it is far more
                    likely to happen if they do. Self-organizing creates mutual respect. A project manager can leave a
                    team manager to focus on product delivery where the team manager feels trusted. This principle
                    extends far beyond the work. It includes the way the team works and the way team members behave
                    towards one another. Although the project board is ultimately accountable for the direction of the
                    project as a whole, the more a team is empowered at the delivery level, the more likely it is to
                    perform well when working in an agile context and achieve the outcomes and goals of that
                    direction.</p>
                <p>A children’s party can be a very good example of self-organization. At the end of a party it is
                    likely that a house will be very untidy with toys and games everywhere. Let’s say that the children
                    have been promised a film, and that there is only a short time until the film starts. Instead of
                    micro-managing the children, a parent lets the children know that they can all see the film if
                    everything is put away tidily and in its right place. As a result, the house gets tidied and the
                    children see the film.</p>
                <h3>7.4.5 Exploration</h3>
                <p>Projects are difficult, and in order to create ‘the right thing’ you need to be able to work out what
                    ‘the right thing’ is! Frequent iteration and rapid feedback loops in any form provide an opportunity
                    to learn. Learning helps to improve the products. However, feedback won’t just happen; it needs to
                    be sought out collaboratively – perhaps through experiments and spikes, with people such as the
                    customer, customer representatives, other team members or stakeholders.</p>

                        Definition: Experiment<br>
                        An investigation into something that is carried out in a series of specific steps (which may
                        involve research) in order to prove or disprove a theory or idea. This can be used to
                        validate an idea or to try and improve something such as the way a team is working.

                <p>Lots of small learnings about what the customer wants accumulate over time and make a big impact overall.
                    By continually working in loops that deliver something and create feedback, the team can go forward. The
                    shorter these feedback loops are, the quicker progress can be made and the smaller will be the impact of any
                    mistakes. The sooner the team solves ‘known unknowns’ and uncovers ‘unknown unknowns’, the sooner they
                    can arrive at the right destination.</p>

                <h2>7.5 PRINCE2 PRINCIPLES SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>When using PRINCE2 in an agile context it is important to monitor these behaviours and ensure that
                    they are happening as well as possible. Everyone involved in the project should be trying to behave
                    this way as much as possible.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the project board or the project manager will need to monitor the situation, and one
                option is to use a simple traffic light dashboard to highlight any behaviours that are in need of
                attention or may be causing damage to the project (see Figure 7.2). The values will be subjective and
                may be for the project board or project manager only. A green light would mean that the situation is
                fine. Yellow/amber would indicate that there is cause for concern. Red would indicate that immediate
                action is needed.</p>
