                <h2>2.1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>The term ‘agile’ is very broad and is viewed in many different ways throughout the agile community.
                    There is a set of well-known frameworks referred to as ‘agile methods’ and there are also well-known
                    behaviours, concepts and techniques that are recognized as characterizing the agile way of working.
                    But there is no single definition of agile that accurately encapsulates them all, although the Agile
                    Manifesto (see Figure 2.1) comes the closest to achieving this.</p>
                <h3>2.1.1 Some history</h3>
                <p>The term ‘agile’ was created in 2001 (www.agilemanifesto.org) when a group of ‘independent thinkers
                    around software development’ came together to talk about an alternative to the heavyweight,
                    document-driven processes that existed at the time. Known as the ‘Waterfall methodology’ (see Figure
                    2.2), these old-fashioned processes comprised a sequence of technical phases that were slow and
                    struggled to respond to changing requirements, particularly when they were mired in too much detail
                    from the start</p>
                <p>The group was already working in ways that later become described as agile; an output from this
                    meeting was the Manifesto for agile Software Development, or the ‘Agile Manifesto’ as it is more
                    commonly known, and its impact and success have been quite dramatic. The Agile Manifesto is
                    summarized in Figure 2.1; it also contains 12 principles which are listed in Appendix E.1. It is
                    important to appreciate the intent of the final two lines of the Agile Manifesto: it is a case of
                    relative importance of the values, and not a case of ‘good’ or ‘bad’.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Figure02-002.PNG" style="width: 100%;"/>
                    <figcaption>Fig 02-001 The contrast between Waterfall and agile phases</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The reason for agile becoming so popular was that it helped to address the new demands being placed
                    on how software was delivered. Software needed to be produced more frequently whilst at the same
                    time being of the appropriate level of quality to meet the demands of new technologies, the internet
                    and the digital era. In contrast to the Waterfall way of working, agile phases are smaller and more
                    iterative and incremental (see Figure 2.2).</p>
                <p>By definition, the Agile Manifesto only applies to developing software, and most of its underlying
                    principles appear to suggest that this is in the context of the continual timeboxed development of a
                    software product. Although it was created as a way to develop software, it has since been recognized
                    as a successful approach beyond software development, and many people use the Agile Manifesto,
                    replacing the word ‘software’ with ‘products’ or ‘solutions’.</p>
                <h3>2.1.2 Agile today</h3>
                <p>Agile has come a long way since 2001 and is no longer just ‘an IT thing’. It now includes situations
                    that are large scale, complex in nature and happening in a wide array of contexts far beyond
                    software development.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, most if not all organizations are aware of the term agile, and every organization should
                    have a strategy in place to adopt it to some degree. For many years it was seen as a niche area; it
                    is now mainstream and is used by organizations that are large and small, old and new, public sector
                    and private sector</p>
                <h2>2.2 AGILE BASICS</h2>
                <p>When combining PRINCE2 with agile it is important to know what agile is, otherwise an inconsistent
                    view of the basics of agile will make combining the two difficult (e.g. if someone in an
                    organization thinks that agile can only be used on the IT part of a project, whereas someone else
                    thinks it can be applied across the whole project, then this will present a problem)</p>
                <p>A basic view of agile could generally be seen as one or more of the following (see Figure 2.3):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using a timeboxed and iterative approach to delivering software</li>
                    <li>Using a collection of techniques such as daily stand-up meetings, sprints and user stories
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the Scrum framework (see Table 2.1).</li>
                </ul>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/Figure02-003.PNG" style="width: 100%;"/>
                    <figcaption>Fig 02-003 A basic ‘backlog’ and ‘sprint’ structure for delivering software
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This is a very common structure used when working in an agile way for developing software. In simple
                    terms, new features for a product are held in a prioritized list called the product backlog. The
                    list may be made up of user stories, which are structured in a way that describes who wants the
                    feature and why. The team that will build the features decides on what items from the top of the
                    product backlog they can create in a timeframe of typically two to four weeks (which is known as a
                    sprint). The work that the team think they can achieve during the sprint is held in a list called a
                    sprint backlog. Each day throughout the sprint, a meeting is held to assess progress. At the end of
                    a sprint new features should have been created and they may go into operational use. The output
                    (i.e. the new features) is reviewed along with the way the team worked to achieve that output</p>

                        Definition: Release<br> A general term used to describe a collection of features that will be
                        moved into (or near to) operational use (or the act of doing this). In PRINCE2 Agile, a release
                        is typically a container for more than one low-level timebox (e.g. a sprint) but this is not
                        necessarily the case as the act of releasing features into operational use may happen more
                        regularly (e.g. after each sprint or several times during a sprint). The term ‘deployment’ is
                        sometimes used in agile and has a similar meaning, although it is not used in PRINCE2 Agile.

                <p>This basic structure may exist within an overall approach that includes a vision, a product roadmap
                    (which is a plan of how a product will evolve) and a series of releases (see Figure 2.4)</p>

                <p>The two examples represented in Figures 2.3 and 2.4 provide a typical view of agile, although it is
                    somewhat limited. A more comprehensive view would include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IT and non-IT situations</li>
                    <li>Large and small projects as well as routine ‘business as usual’ (BAU) tasks</li>
                    <li>Flow-based working as well as timeboxing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Further to this there also needs to be a wider mind-set and a collection of behaviours that enable
                    the agile way of working to thrive.</p>

                <h3>2.2.1 Agile frameworks</h3>
                <p>There is a family of frameworks (also referred to as methods or approaches) that are generally
                    recognized as being agile. However, some are only applicable to IT situations. A summary of the most
                    well known is shown in Table 2.1.</p>
                <h3>2.2.2 Agile behaviours, concepts and techniques</h3>
                <p>Along with the agile frameworks there are a variety of behaviours, concepts and techniques that are
                    seen as being part of the agile way of working. Examples are shown in Table 2.2 (some of which are
                    defined in the glossary) but the table only provides a few illustrative examples of what is seen as
                    agile. It is not a complete list and it is not necessary to be strict on the exact terms used (e.g.
                    whether or not something is a technique or a behaviour).</p>

                <p>PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile do not favour one agile approach over any other (this is sometimes referred
                    to as being ‘agile agnostic’), and with due care and consideration, they can engage with agile in
                    all of its many forms to provide a holistic project management approach that can be tailored to suit
                    a wide variety of conditions and working environments.</p>
