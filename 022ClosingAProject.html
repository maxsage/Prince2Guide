                <h2>22.1 PRINCE2 GUIDANCE ON CLOSING A PROJECT</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the Closing a Project process (see Figure 22.1) is to provide a fixed point at which
                    acceptance for the project product is confirmed, and to recognize that objectives set out in the
                    original project initiation documentation have been achieved (or approved changes to the objectives
                    have been achieved), or that the project has nothing more to contribute</p>
                <p>One of the defining features of a PRINCE2 project is that it is finite – it has a start and an end.
                    If the project loses this distinctiveness, it loses some of its advantages over purely operational
                    management approaches.</p>
                <p>A clear end to a project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is always more successful than a slow drift into use as it is a recognition by all concerned
                        that:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The original objectives have been met (subject to any approved changes)</li>
                        <li>The current project has run its course</li>
                        <li>Either the operational regime must now take over the products from this project, or the
                            products become inputs into some subsequent project or into some larger programme
                        </li>
                        <li>The project management team can be disbanded</li>
                        <li>Project costs should no longer be incurred</li></ul>
                        <li>Provides an opportunity to ensure that all unachieved goals and objectives are identified so
                        that they can be addressed in the future</li>
                        <li>Transfers ownership of the products to the customer and terminates the responsibility of the
                        project management team.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                <p>Closure activities should be planned as part of the stage plan for the final management stage. When
                    Closing a Project, work is required to prepare input to the project board in order to obtain its
                    authorization to close the project. Subsequently, the executive should also notify corporate or
                    programme management that the project has closed.</p>
                <p>It is also possible that the project board may wish to trigger a premature closure of the project
                    under some circumstances (for example, if the business case is no longer valid). If the project is
                    being brought to a premature close, this process will still need to be executed but may have to be
                    tailored to the actual project situation.</p>
                <p>A number of actions specific to the project’s products may be required after the project, and these
                    should be documented and planned for as follow-on action recommendations. These may have different
                    audiences and therefore may need to be issued individually. The needs of the recipient will
                    determine the format and content – some may want a formal report, some a log entry on a system, and
                    others a meeting.</p>
                <h2>22.2 AGILE WAYS OF WORKING THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST</h2>
                <p>It is possible in some agile environments that there aren’t many defined processes with respect to
                    closing down a project, although mature agile environments will have these in place. This is
                    primarily because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular handovers (preferably carried out collaboratively) into operational use (or near
                        operational use) reduce some of the need to formalize certain activities at the end, as they
                        have become second nature (e.g. process reviews, updating operational documentation, getting
                        sign-off/acceptance).</li>
                    <li>Ending a piece of work is often decided upon at the time (when added value has become marginal)
                        as opposed to in advance, or when acceptance criteria become satisfied.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Due to the iterative and incremental nature of agile, the frequency of the delivery of product into
                    operational use, and ease of delivery, are usually good indicators of the level of maturity of agile
                    within an organization.</p>
                <h2>22.3 PRINCE2 AGILE GUIDANCE ON CLOSING A PROJECT</h2>
                <p>Tailoring guidance that may be appropriate is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project closure may take the form of a workshop (see section 22.4) where the original baseline
                        is checked in relation to the final outputs and outcomes of the project, and preparation for
                        closure authorization can take place. This may include a review of the final release.
                    </li>
                    <li>Benefits may have already been enabled and be delivering value.</li>
                    <li>End-of-project activities should already be in an advanced state of completeness due to frequent
                        releases gradually improving how project closure is done and populating information. For
                        example:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project/process evaluation should be ongoing through the frequent use of retrospectives.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continual use of ‘inspect and adapt’ would mean that the lessons report has been created as
                            the project has gone along, and many of the lessons would have already been actioned and
                            evaluated from retrospectives at both the project and delivery levels.
                        </li>
                        <li>User acceptance would be happening regularly, although care should be taken to ensure that
                            user acceptance is not too informal when closing the project in order to ensure that the
                            customer’s quality expectations and acceptance criteria have been met.</li>
                        <li>Operational handovers (and acceptance) are likely to have happened many times due to the
                            incremental delivery of products, so the final handover should be a routine event.
                        </li>
                        <li>Training and technical documentation would be finalized, as it would have been created
                            iteratively and incrementally throughout the project.
                        </li></ul>

                <h3>22.4.1 An example of how to close a PRINCE2 Agile project</h3>
                <p>An ideal way to close a project would be with a workshop involving all of the key project
                    stakeholders. Ideally this would be independently facilitated and use information from project-level
                    information radiators that have been used throughout the project. It may even take place in the room
                    or area where the project took place and the project management team worked.</p>
                <p>The whole project team should be present (e.g. the project board, project assurance) along with other
                    stakeholders such as those who will make the final product operational (or the final release of the
                    product operational), those who will maintain and support it, and those from the strategic level who
                    will be interested in the project outcome from a programme perspective.</p>
                <p>The following is an example of how a workshop could be structured:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Final product demo</strong> In order to achieve sign-off from the customer. This would not be a ‘big
                        event’ as it would be the last in a regular and frequent series of demonstrations. There
                        shouldn’t be any surprises here and it will not be a ‘big reveal’ due to the constant customer
                        involvement throughout the project that has resulted in a lot of transparency and interaction.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-on actions</strong> These could be assigned to people formally or verbally or even by handing them
                        a sticky note from an information radiator. Collectively the workshop participants could decide
                        if unfinished work could be moved over to an appropriate BAU backlog, or handed over to the
                        strategic/programme level as potentially a new project. Correctly addressing outstanding actions
                        is most effectively done when the parties affected are in attendance and can discuss the
                        relative merits of the options available.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Checking against the baseline</strong> The final project-level information radiators and a demonstrable
                        product could be compared with the original vision and baseline information, along with other
                        supporting documentation that the project was justified against. The information radiators would
                        typically show the project product description, the business case and the project plan and would
                        have dynamically displayed this information throughout the project.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reviewing the use of agile</strong> This would involve assessing how well the delivery teams, and the
                        project management team as a whole, used retrospectives to address issues and risks as they went
                        along. Further to this, the use of the Agilometer should be checked to see if it had been
                        assessed correctly and to determine if lessons about the use of agile on this project, and how
                        the associated risks were handled, could be used on other projects. Ideally, project support
                        would be in attendance to capture these learnings.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Closing the event</strong> Perhaps the executive (depending on personal style), who would be there to
                        look at the final costs, could thank the team and celebrate the end in some form such as a team
                        meal. When a project has involved high levels of collaboration and teamwork, and the team is
                        disbanded, it can result in a degree of ‘mourning’ for the team members, so this should be
                        anticipated and ideas suggested as to how to reduce this
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>22.4.2 Premature close</h3>
                <p>If the project has closed prematurely, it could have been triggered by a fail fast/learn fast
                    situation caused by the correct use of management by exception (for example, a stage boundary was
                    reached and the project was no longer viable, or tolerances were forecast to be exceeded and it was
                    not worth taking remedial action). Many agile techniques are designed to help with this, such as
                    timeboxing or empirical forecasting, which forces the ‘bad’ news to surface in a transparent
                    way.</p>
                <p>If a project is going to fail it is best that failure arrives as quickly as possible. Many agile
                    techniques and ways of working can contribute to this, but the following are the most
                    significant:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Empirical forecasting</li>
                    <li>Transparency</li>
                    <li>Timeboxing</li>
                    <li>Sprint (or release) demonstrations, reviews and retrospectives</li>
                    <li>Shortening the feedback loop to the customer</li>
                    <li>Frequent customer interaction</li>
                    <li>Experimentation, prototyping and spiking</li>
                    <li>Early enablement of benefits that did not accrue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of these concepts and techniques create or force a clear understanding of what is being attempted
                    and can therefore highlight that a project or stage will take too long, cost too much, will fail to
                    work or the project objectives have not been set correctly.</p>
                <h2>22.5 SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 uses the Closing a Project process in order to clearly confirm that the project has ended and
                    that the purpose for it has been met and accepted by the customer.</p>
                <p>When using agile this is still likely to be a formal event but an event in which most of the
                    information is already known and most of the work already done due to the iterative and incremental
                    nature of the agile way of working. Examples of this would be that benefits are already being
                    accrued, most of the project’s products are in operational use and documentation is almost complete
                    and just needs to be finalized.</p>
                <p>This then allows for a smooth and efficient closure of the project and helps the project manager and
                    project board to do this with the minimum of effort thereby enabling them to move on to other work
                    and other projects without delay</p>
