                <h1>6 What to fix and what to flex?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Of the many ideas, concepts and techniques that exist within PRINCE2 Agile, one of the most important
                    is that it focuses on flexing what is being delivered, as opposed to focusing on flexing time and
                    cost or flexing time and resources.</p>
                <p>However, it is not enough just to understand how to flex what is delivered; it is essential to
                    understand why.</p>
                <p>Historically, the competing constraints on a project have often been shown graphically as a shape
                    such as a triangle with constraints of time, cost, quality etc. pulling against each other. PRINCE2
                    does not have such a limited view of the variables on a project, as it identifies six ‘aspects’ that
                    need to be controlled and managed: time, cost, quality, scope, risk and benefit.</p>
                <p>PRINCE2 does not place emphasis on any of these aspects over and above the others. It sees them as
                    equally significant and to be managed according to the needs of a particular project.</p>
                <p>However, PRINCE2 Agile does define what to emphasize by giving guidance on the use of tolerance
                    levels (i.e. permissible deviations from what is planned) for the six aspects in terms of which
                    should be fixed and which ones should vary (or flex) (see Table 6.1).</p>
                <p>In PRINCE2, tolerance is the permissible deviation above and below what has been planned, with
                    respect to the six aspects of a project (i.e. time, cost, quality, scope, risk and benefit).
                    Whenever any of these tolerances are forecast to be exceeded an exception will occur. It’s not that
                    fixed aspects can never flex, but they have tolerances set to zero and would be subject to
                    management by exception if these were expected to be exceeded.</p>
                <h2>6.1 THE CONCEPT OF FLEXING WHAT IS DELIVERED</h2>
                <p>PRINCE2 Agile is built upon the concept of flexing what is delivered. This can also be described as
                    prioritizing what is delivered. This, for many, may require a fundamental shift in how a project is
                    executed. It is not a nuance or a ‘different flavour’: it represents a significant change in how
                    people think and act when they are working on a project.</p>

                <h2>6.2 WHY IS THERE A NEED TO WORK THIS WAY?</h2>
                <p>The internet and the dramatic increase in the use of technology have created a paradigm shift in
                    terms of how quickly people want things such as information and products.</p>
                <p>These needs have created a shift over many years from the desire for completeness to the desire for
                    timeliness. Projects and products do not exist in isolation. One example of this is where a company
                    may be creating a product that is competing against several other similar products in a marketplace.
                    In this situation, is it more important to have the best product in the marketplace or to produce
                    the first product in the marketplace? In truth, both points are important, but the agile mind-set is
                    to deliver early, regularly and incrementally, thereby increasing customer confidence and reducing
                    the risk of delivering the wrong thing.</p>
                <p>This means that any approaches to project management that are Waterfall-based are not appropriate as
                    they do not explicitly provide the mechanisms for flexing what is being delivered in a timeboxed
                    way.</p>
                <h2>6.3 THE RATIONALE BEHIND FLEXING WHAT IS BEING DELIVERED</h2>
                <p>The rationale behind flexing what is being delivered is not straightforward and it can take time to
                    understand the thinking behind it. It may even be the case that the theory is only understood when
                    delivery is seen in practice. Either way, the need to understand this concept fully is essential for
                    the correct use of PRINCE2 Agile.</p>
                <p>The thinking behind being flexible with what is delivered is based around five targets, which when
                    taken together provide a compelling case for moving to this way of working. These five targets are
                    described in Table 6.2.</p>
                <h2>6.4 THE FIVE TARGETS IN MORE DETAIL</h2>
                <p>As previously mentioned, it is very important to understand the thinking behind flexing what is being
                    delivered and not just do it ‘because that’s what the manual says’. The following sections outline
                    the deeper and more specific reasons why PRINCE2 Agile involves basing the way a team thinks and
                    acts on a different paradigm from that on which projects have traditionally been based.</p>

                <h3>6.4.1 Being on time and hitting deadlines</h3>
                <p>For any project or piece of work being on time is naturally seen as desirable, but the advantages
                    that meeting deadlines creates may not all be obvious; when the many upsides of this are taken
                    together, it creates something that should be seen as essential as opposed to just desirable.</p>
                <p>Some of these advantages can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delivering early realization of benefits, and these can be planned around</li>
                    <li>Helping with planning (e.g. dependencies within a project or between projects, capacity and
                        resources at the portfolio and programme level)
                    </li>
                    <li>Giving confidence (e.g. with progress)</li>
                    <li>There may be no choice (e.g. external market forces or regulatory considerations)</li>
                    <li>Reducing the likelihood of cost overruns (assuming that resources are fixed)</li>
                    <li>Improving reputation (e.g. with the customer).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>‘Being on time and hitting deadlines’ applies to any timescale – short-term (e.g. a two-week sprint),
                    mediumterm (e.g. a two-month stage) or long-term (a six-month project).</p>
                <h3>6.4.2 Protecting the level of quality</h3>
                <p>Any framework for projects or product delivery strives to ensure that the appropriate level of
                    quality is achieved. However, in practice does the level of quality suffer (or is at risk of
                    suffering) due to the very nature of the approach being used? For example, when using a traditional
                    Waterfall lifecycle that is broken down into ‘technical’ phases such as analyse, design, build, test
                    and implement (NB: PRINCE2 is built around ‘management stages’ and not ‘technical stages’), there is
                    a risk that frequently materializes of the earlier phases overrunning, leading to later phases
                    becoming compressed in order to deliver on time. The most common example of this is where quality
                    checking or testing is reduced in order to meet deadlines.</p>

                        Tip<br> Acceptance criteria is a term that is commonly used in agile to assess whether a user
                        story has been completed. It is the equivalent to quality criteria in PRINCE2.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The concept of flexing what is being delivered ensures that the emphasis is on delivering less scope
                    or using lower-priority quality criteria, as opposed to compromising the overall quality level of
                    the final product (as described by the customer’s quality expectations and the associated acceptance
                    criteria).</p>
                <p>Compromising the quality level of anything delivered during a project can take many forms but results
                    from such situations as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced testing</li>
                    <li>Incomplete documentation</li>
                    <li>Sub-optimal design</li>
                    <li>Lack of appropriate training (e.g. for end-users, customers, support teams)</li>
                    <li>Non-compliance with standards.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The result of any compromise to the level of quality can have damaging long-term effects in terms of
                    the total cost of ownership of the final product as it may suffer from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced usability</li>
                    <li>Significant support requirements</li>
                    <li>Degraded performance</li>
                    <li>Lack of engagement with the user community.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, this should be avoided. PRINCE2 Agile protects the level of quality and ensures that
                    deadlines are met by reducing the amount delivered by the project but not reducing activities that
                    ensure that the quality level is met.</p>
                <h3>6.4.3 Embracing change</h3>
                <p>Change is inevitable when working on anything difficult so it is best to expect it and prepare for
                    it. Change can take the form of a new idea that has not previously been thought of or a
                    misunderstanding where an assumption proves to be incorrect. Change should be seen as positive
                    because a more accurate final product is likely to be produced.</p>
                <p>It is important to distinguish between minor change (e.g. to the detail) and major change (e.g. to
                    the project baseline) because only the former can be handled dynamically and with little overhead.
                    This illustrates the importance of setting the project baseline in the project initiation
                    documentation at the correct level (e.g. avoiding unnecessary detail early on).</p>

                </div>
                <p>Minor change can be handled by flexing what is being delivered through prioritization and trading (or
                    swapping), whereas major change would usually require more formal change control processes and may
                    even necessitate going into exception and/or stopping the project if the business case is no longer
                    viable.</p>
                <h3>6.4.4 Keeping teams stable: avoid adding new team members</h3>
                <p>If a project falls behind schedule a traditional response would be to consider the option of
                    increasing the number of people involved in order to speed up progress. In some circumstances where
                    the work being undertaken is reasonably straightforward, this can solve the problem. However, when
                    the work is more challenging it probably won’t – particularly in the short term. This is the primary
                    reason why the tolerance for cost is set to zero.</p>
                <p>Although this has an impact in any situation, the agile way of working is particularly impacted by
                    the changing of personnel because agile utilizes such things as informal communication and
                    self-organizing whilst scheduling work into short timeframes (e.g. a two-week timebox). Therefore,
                    changing team members or adding to the team can have a far more detrimental effect than normal for
                    reasons such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time is spent bringing new team members up to speed.</li>
                    <li>The number of communication lines in the team grows exponentially.</li>
                    <li>There is an opportunity cost incurred to the areas providing the new people.</li>
                    <li>The team dynamics change and need to be re-established.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The impact of changing a team’s dynamics is usually underestimated and can sometimes be the most
                    counter-productive side-effect of the four.</p>

                <p>It is important to understand that team members may need to change throughout the life of a project
                    as the needs of a project change, but this concept of avoiding the use of extra people to improve
                    progress applies primarily to the short term – for example four weeks or less, such as within a
                    sprint.</p>

                <h3>6.4.5 Do we need everything we have asked for?</h3>
                <p>Usually no, although the customer may not realize this at the start of a project. This point can be
                    easily demonstrated by looking at products we frequently use and analysing how many of the functions
                    and features we rarely or never use. A washing machine is perhaps a good example of this in that it
                    would normally contain many functions and features as well as a wide range of spin speeds,
                    temperature settings and programmes, yet it would be unusual to find many people who used more than
                    just a few of the options available. Most people would use two programmes at most.</p>
                <p>The importance of this concept lies in the PRINCE2 Agile belief that the features of the product are
                    the safest and most sensible area to compromise on (i.e. to use as contingency). A project using
                    PRINCE2 Agile doesn’t set out with the intention of not delivering everything, but it does aim to
                    hit deadlines and protect the level of quality by reducing what is delivered accordingly. This in
                    turn can result in the early delivery of a minimum viable product (MVP), and in general terms the
                    project delivers what the customer really wants (or needs) more quickly.</p>
                <h2>6.5 CHAPTER SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>It is important to understand all of the five targets that underpin the thinking behind flexing what
                    is being delivered. The five targets do not operate in isolation: they are interwoven and together
                    they provide a lot of the reasoning behind the agile way of working.</p>
                <p>It could be said that flexing what is being delivered represents an ‘alternative deal’ to the way
                    people have traditionally worked. In its simplest form this new arrangement asks the customer a
                    question: namely, ‘If you want your project delivered on time, the level of quality protected and
                    changes at the detailed level to be handled dynamically and at no extra cost … are you happy to
                    forgo some of your lower-priority requirements or lower-priority acceptance/quality criteria, if
                    necessary?’ (see Figure 6.2).</p>
                <p>Getting an appropriate balance of what is essential and what is not essential becomes important when
                    working this way. If the balance is not conducive to flexing what is being delivered (e.g. there is
                    very little that can be described as not essential) then this creates a risk to this way of working
                    and in extreme situations (e.g. where practically everything is essential), it may make the use of
                    agile on a project inadvisable.</p>
                <p>A lot of the understanding of agile falls into place when the thinking behind flexing what is being
                    delivered is understood correctly. One of the reasons that agile is often misunderstood or hard to
                    understand at times is that these concepts are a mixture of common sense (e.g. being on time) and
                    ideas that are counterintuitive (e.g. seeing change in a positive light).</p>
                <p>In order for a customer to understand that this is for their benefit, they need to see the holistic
                    view that is supported by flexing what is being delivered. If this is not achieved then the customer
                    may feel that flexing will not deliver everything they want. It would be unlikely that this will be
                    seen as an attractive proposition.</p>
