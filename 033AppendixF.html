                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>A common mistake made by many organizations is to see working in a more agile way as the goal to
                        be achieved, as opposed to seeing it as an enabler to help the organization achieve its goals.
                        Agile should be seen as a means to an end and not an end in itself.</p>
                    <p>Organizations and individuals looking to use agile, or improve their agile, should understand the
                        problems they are trying to solve, or the opportunities they are looking to leverage, before
                        commencing on any transition to a new or different way of working.</p>
                    <p>With respect to ‘traditional’ projects, there are many common problems that are encountered –
                        such as delivering the final product late, being over budget, the solution containing defects or
                        the solution not being what the customer was expecting.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, when using PRINCE2 and agile together to solve the aforementioned problems and improve
                        how benefits are delivered to internal or external customers, it is important to create a
                        baseline of where the organization currently is, before starting on a journey of transition.
                        From this baseline the organization can set goals to be achieved and create plans to help to
                        achieve them. This can then be used at a future date to see what impact using agile with PRINCE2
                        has had.</p>
                    <h2>F.1 DIFFERENT FORMS OF SUCCESS</h2>
                    <p>When using PRINCE2 and agile on a project it is important to distinguish between the following
                        three different types of success:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The success of the business case in terms of the benefits delivered</li>
                        <li>The success of the project and the project management involved</li>
                        <li>The success of the agile way of working.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Aside from exceptional or unusual situations, it will always be the benefits that are the most
                        important. Different stakeholders may have their own measures of success depending on whether
                        they are suppliers or customers and what benefits they stand to gain from the project. Even if
                        there are problems using PRINCE2 or agile or there are complications with the project, the
                        customer may still be very happy if the product produced sells well and achieves the benefits
                        that were forecast. Conversely, the customer is unlikely to be happy if PRINCE2 and agile
                        enabled the project to come in ahead of time and under budget, yet the final product didn’t sell
                        anything as well as expected.</p>
                    <p>It is important to understand the relative merits of these three areas as they have a very clear
                        order of priority.</p>
                    <p>It is important that all of these three areas are measured, and it is a sign of an organization’s
                        maturity as to how well this is achieved and how the results are acted upon.</p>
                    <p>When measuring these three areas, it is important that there are no overlaps or blurring of
                        boundaries between the areas, as they are quite different.</p>
                    <p>Measuring the success of the project and the success of the business case is already covered by
                        PRINCE2, but measuring the success of how agile has been used is not. The areas to look at when
                        reviewing the success or otherwise are identified by the Agilometer in Chapter 24. The question
                        to ask for each of the sliders is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How much did each area help?</li>
                        <li>How much did each area hinder?</li>
                        <li>Did we assess the slider correctly at the start of the project?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When an organization invests in improving how projects are delivered, it is important to be able
                        to assess the merits of that investment. It is also important to be able to distinguish between
                        the benefits delivered (as a whole) by the appropriate use of PRINCE2 and the benefits delivered
                        by agile (as a whole). It may turn out to be the case that the benefits have been achieved
                        through using the two together, as the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2, agile and PRINCE2 with agile are all enablers. Their contribution needs to be measured.
                        If it is not being measured, it will not be possible to gauge success.</p>
