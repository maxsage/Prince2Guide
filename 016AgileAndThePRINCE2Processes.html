                    <p>PRINCE2 is a process-based approach to project management and has seven processes (containing activities)
                        which apply to all levels of a project. All seven processes are required, and agile needs to be incorporated into
                        all of them in some form. The amount of agile that is relevant to each process varies significantly, and
                        therefore the amount of tailoring required varies accordingly.</p>
                    <h2>16.1 THE PRINCE2 PROCESSES</h2>
                    <p>PRINCE2 is a process-based approach for project management. A process is a structured set of
                        activities designed to accomplish a specific objective. It takes one or more defined inputs and
                        turns them into defined outputs.</p>
                    <p>There are seven processes in PRINCE2, which provide the set of activities required to direct,
                        manage and deliver a project successfully.</p>
                    <p>Figure 16.1 shows how each process is used throughout a project’s life.</p>
                    <p>PRINCE2 can be used on projects irrespective of project scale, complexity, geography, culture
                        etc. PRINCE2 can also be used whether the project is part of a programme or is being managed as
                        a stand-alone initiative. This reflects the principle that PRINCE2 must be tailored to suit the
                        particular project context; PRINCE2 Agile is an example of such tailoring to suit an agile
                        context.</p>
                    <p>A mature agile environment may have many processes in existence that address the areas of project
                        direction and stages (or an equivalent concept to stages), as well as processes to ensure that a
                        project is started and ended in a controlled way.</p>

                    <h2>16.2 TAILORING GUIDANCE FOR THE PRINCE2 PROCESSES</h2>
                    <p>Figure 16.2 shows the seven PRINCE2 processes and the PRINCE2 management products (see Table 16.1
                        for a key to the abbreviations). More detail of how sprints and flow-based timeboxes are
                        incorporated are shown in the inset, which has been expanded in Figure 16.3.</p>
                    <p>The numbers in Figures 16.2 and 16.3 refer to the PRINCE2 management products as identified in
                        the PRINCE2 manual and shown in Table 16.2 (see Chapter 23 and Appendix A for further
                        information about the products).</p>
                    <p>Figure 16.3 shows how releases and low-level timeboxes (i.e. as sprints or flow-based) may appear
                        inside a PRINCE2 management stage. The figure assumes a common agile situation where a product
                        backlog is used to create a series of releases, and each release in turn creates a series of
                        sprints (e.g. when using Scrum) or is run as one timebox using a flow-based approach (e.g. when
                        using Kanban).</p>

                    <p>Although this represents a common approach there are many other equally valid situations (see

                    <ul>
                        <li>Releases and release backlogs are not used because sprints and sprint backlogs are all that
                            are required. In this case a sprint may result in a release of features into operational
                            use, or a release of features into a staging area or an interim deliverable which is of use
                            to the project.</li>
                        <li
                        >Releases happen so frequently that they are not treated as a type of timebox or in need of a
                            release backlog. In this case a release may happen at the end of each timebox or on more
                            than one occasion during the timebox.</li>
                        <li>A management stage could relate to just one release.</li>
