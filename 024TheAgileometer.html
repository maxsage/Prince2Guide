                    <h2>24.1 PURPOSE</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this focus area is to describe how to assess the agile environment in order to
                        tailor PRINCE2 in the most effective way. Every project situation is different in some form due
                        to factors such as the level of trust between the customer and the supplier, the technology
                        being used or the level of uncertainty. Therefore it is important to decide in advance how to
                        address these advantages and disadvantages in order to run a project in the most effective way
                        from an agile perspective.</p>
                    <p>In order to receive the most benefit from using a method or approach it is essential to adjust
                        and adapt it to suit the context and conditions it is operating in. PRINCE2 is no exception to
                        this rule and it provides a lot of guidance on how to tailor PRINCE2 for any project situation.
                        The aim of the Agilometer is to provide further guidance (with respect to agile considerations)
                        that will create a level of control and predictability, without becoming overly
                        prescriptive.</p>
                    <p>Take the analogy of driving a car. A typical car provides a mode of transport and has many
                        features to help make a journey in a safe manner (e.g. engine, lights, wipers); however, it
                        still needs a driver to make decisions and use those features to control the car appropriately.
                        On a regular car journey the route and the destination may not change but the conditions do.
                        This is why a driver drives differently in snow and on ice compared with driving on a dry road
                        on a sunny day. Importantly, assessing the conditions before the journey commences helps improve
                        the chances of carrying out the journey in the safest and most effective way.</p>
                    <h2>24.2 WHEN TO ASSESS SUITABILITY</h2>
                    <p>Agile suitability is assessed throughout the project (e.g. during retrospectives). It is
                        specifically assessed during pre-project and again, in a more detailed way, during the
                        initiation stage. The results of these assessments would appear in the project brief and the
                        project initiation documentation in order to provide the project board with information to help
                        shape its decision to authorize any work. It is important that the project board has enough
                        awareness of agile in general, so that it can understand what the assessment is saying and make
                        an informed decision about such things as potential areas of risk or benefit.</p>
                    <p>As an example, a situation may occur where a project is assessed as being ideal for a highly
                        agile approach, but the project board is concerned that the approach is susceptible to certain
                        risks (e.g. the customer is unable to sustain its involvement) and therefore requests that more
                        governance is put in place in this area. Further to this example, another scenario may involve a
                        project being assessed as ‘neutral’ or ‘average’ in terms of how much agile can be used, but the
                        project board realizes that too much formal reporting has been put in place and the business
                        case is not viable unless more frequent deliveries of benefits take place (e.g. it needs the
                        earlier realization of benefits or earlier customer feedback, and therefore is happy to receive
                        reports in a much more informal manner or by other means).</p>
                    <p>These examples show that all the project team members need to understand the risks and benefits
                        associated with agile in order to get the most from it. It is not something that is only
                        relevant at the delivery level or to the project manager.</p>
                    <h2>24.3 HOW SUITABILITY IS ASSESSED (THE AGILOMETER)</h2>
                    <p>It is the project manager’s role to facilitate the agile assessment, as this will affect how the
                        project is managed.</p>
                    <p>In order to tailor PRINCE2 in the best way possible it is important to assess the context that a
                        project exists in with regard to the environment and the working relationships. To achieve this
                        PRINCE2 Agile has an assessment tool called the Agilometer (see Figure 24.1) to answer the
                        question of ‘How agile can we be on this project?’</p>
                    <p>The Agilometer looks at six key areas, and the project manager is responsible for canvassing the
                        key stakeholders involved in the project as to what values to give each category. Each category
                        is represented on the figure by a slider. Each slider is described in more detail in section
                        24.7</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/Figure24-001.PNG" style="width: 100%;" />
                        <figcaption>Fig 24-001 The Agilometer</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>When using the Agilometer it is important to see it as a guide to help you make an informed
                        decision. The Agilometer itself does not make a decision or offer any recommendations. Further
                        to this it is important to see each slider in isolation and not to create an average score
                        across all areas.</p>
                    <p>The Agilometer shows where there are risk areas with using agile. It also shows the opposite:
                        i.e. where there are benefits with using agile</p>
                    <p>An example of using the Agilometer correctly would be a response such as ‘The collaboration
                        slider is quite low: what can we do to improve it?’</p>
                    <p>An example of how to use it incorrectly would be the statement ‘The average score across all of
                        the sliders is 3.9, so the context is favourable to the agile way of working.’</p>
                    <p>The Agilometer illustrates areas that are favourable or may present risks. Averaging out the
                        sliders can obscure this information.</p>
                    <h2>24.4 RESPONDING TO THE ASSESSMENT</h2>
                    <p>After using the Agilometer to create an assessment, the next step is to see what can be done to
                        improve the sliders and shift them further to the right. Here are some simple examples of how to
                        move a slider:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>24.5 MONITORING THE ASSESSMENT</h2>
                    <p>The assessment can be reviewed at various times throughout the project – for example, at stage
                        end or after a release – to see if the settings on the Agilometer are happening as predicted.
                        Any deviation between the prediction and reality as perceived by the team would result in a
                        change to the project management or delivery process. A slider that is much further left than
                        predicted is likely to mean that an area of risk has been created. A slider much further to the
                        right than predicted could mean that less governance or control is needed in certain areas.</p>
                    <h2>24.6 EVOLVING THE AGILOMETER</h2>
                    <p>From a wider organizational or programme-level viewpoint, it is important to see the Agilometer
                        (as it appears in this manual) as only a starting point. Organizations need to evolve their own
                        Agilometer as they may need to include factors that are specific to themselves, representing
                        significant areas of risk and benefit to working in an agile way. It is best to keep this
                        concept relatively simple. Too many sliders can cloud the information needed to answer
                        reasonably simple questions, such as ‘How agile can we be on this project?’ ‘What are the risks
                        and benefits that are likely to happen?’ As each project uses the Agilometer, continual
                        improvement can be used to tune it to suit future projects.</p>
                    <h3>24.6.1 Apply appropriately</h3>
                    <p>Agile needs to be applied appropriately to the context and the conditions of a project. It will
                        be highly unlikely that you can apply it in the same way when building a nuclear submarine as
                        you would when you are producing a new chocolate bar. PRINCE2 Agile highlights the factors that
                        need to be addressed, and advises on possible courses of action. Tailoring is essential on all
                        projects, as no two projects are identical.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that the prevailing conditions are just too risky for the use of agile to any
                        significant degree, so the Agilometer would highlight that it may be worth using another
                        approach instead. This could even happen during the project, in which case it would need to go
                        into exception.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately the most important point to understand when tailoring the approach to a project is
                        that the result will always be a case of ‘How much agile can we use?’ as opposed to a yes/no
                        decision. In PRINCE2 there is no such thing as an ‘agile project’ or a ‘non-agile project’. How
                        agile you can be on a project is like a spectrum; it is always a matter of degree.</p>
                    <h2>24.7 THE AGILOMETER SLIDER DEFINITIONS</h2>
                    <p>(Only Level 5 is discussed – this indicates the highest and most preferred condition.)</p>
                    <h3>24.7.1 Flexibility on what is delivered</h3>
                    <p>Definition of Level 5: Stakeholders are very comfortable with the fact that change is inevitable
                        and needs to happen in order to converge on an accurate product. They are also very comfortable
                        with the role they need to play in prioritizing the work, and they understand that the scope of
                        the work and the quality criteria are being flexed in order to protect the level of quality and
                        the deadline for what is being delivered. Example behaviours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stakeholders are ‘change friendly’.</li>
                        <li>It is accepted that the detail will change; however, significant changes need to be
                            controlled.
                        </li>
                        <li>Everything is prioritized, using techniques such as MoSCoW.</li>
                        <li>It is understood by all that flexing what is being delivered will protect deadlines and
                            quality, and specifically that this will prevent quality-checking and testing from being
                            squeezed.
                        </li>
                        <li>De-scoping and prioritization will be a team exercise but is customer driven.</li>
                        <li>Embracing change at the detail level produces more accurate products.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>24.7.2 Level of collaboration</h3>
                    <p>Definition of Level 5: There is a very high level of collaboration amongst all parties involved.
                        This is typified by a one-team culture and excellent working relationships both internally and
                        externally. High levels of trust exist and a desire to be helpful is prevalent.</p>
                    <p>Example behaviours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a ‘one-team’ culture in the project team.</li>
                        <li>There is a partnership approach between the customer and the supplier.</li>
                        <li>There is an absence of ‘silos’ and ‘turf’.</li>
                        <li>There is an absence of ‘baggage’ associated with events from the past.</li>
                        <li>Trust and listening epitomize the behaviour of the people involved.</li>
                        <li>People work quickly, are helpful and look out for each other.</li>
                        <li>There is an absence of a blame and ‘cc: email’ culture.</li>
                        <li>There is an acceptance that mistakes will happen due to some communications being
                            informal.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>24.7.3 Ease of communication</h3>
                    <p>Definition of Level 5: Communication is very easy amongst all parties involved. The environment
                        is ‘communication rich’ where there is a lot of face-to-face interaction, and visual information
                        is readily available in such forms as prototypes and models. Retrieval of information is also
                        easy in order to reference knowledge, information or data that is either historical or
                        current.</p>
                    <p>Example behaviours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are high levels of visibility and transparency (e.g. plans on walls).</li>
                        <li>A lot of information is managed in a ‘low-tech’ and/or tactile way.</li>
                        <li>There are high levels of co-location.</li>
                        <li>Where there is a less than ideal situation (e.g. the team is physically dispersed), measures
                            have been taken to reduce the impact (e.g. video-conferencing).
                        </li>
                        <li>There is a lot of informal communication, face-to-face and over the phone.</li>
                        <li>There is a limited amount of formal reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>24.7.4 Ability to work iteratively and deliver incrementally</h3>
                    <p>Definition of Level 5: It is very easy to deliver benefit to the customer by regular partial
                        deliveries of the final product. It is also very easy to work iteratively in the sense that
                        products and understanding can be refined interactively by the frequent delivery of formal and
                        informal deliverables. There is a desire to learn, experiment and explore (and fail!) as well as
                        an overarching feeling of ‘think big; start small’.</p>
                    <p>Example behaviours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The team is happy to experiment and be creative.</li>
                        <li>It is understood that things are rarely right first time.</li>
                        <li>The project can be broken down into chunks that can deliver benefits early.</li>
                        <li>Learning and validation are seen as an ongoing process.</li>
                        <li>‘Little and often’ is seen as a safe way of delivering and a good way of staying in
                            control.
                        </li>
                        <li>Incrementalism is seen as good for ‘real’ feedback and gives confidence to the customer as
                            they see things being delivered.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>24.7.5 Advantageous environmental conditions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition of Level 5:</strong> The overall working environment is very supportive of working in an agile
                        way. Personnel are assigned full-time to their work; they are appropriately skilled; they have
                        very efficient platforms to work from (e.g. tooling, communications). Contractual frameworks and
                        compliance considerations are not seen as restrictive.</p>
                    <p>Example behaviours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People are dedicated to the project and the team is stable.</li>
                        <li>Team personnel are experienced in their trades.</li>
                        <li>Any third parties are comfortable with working in an agile way.</li>
                        <li>Commercial and contractual details do not inhibit the agile way of working and delivering.
                        </li>
                        <li>The environment and tooling are conducive to agile.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>24.7.6 Acceptance of agile</h3>
                    <p>Definition of Level 5: All stakeholders closely involved are fully aware of the behaviours,
                        concepts and techniques of working in an agile way. They have been trained and have experience.
                        They are not only happy to work in this way but they prefer it and understand the advantages
                        that it brings. Peripheral stakeholders are also aware of the need to carry out their roles in
                        an ‘agile friendly’ way.</p>
                    <p>Example behaviours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Everyone accepts the agile philosophy and understands the difference from a traditional way
                            of working.
                        </li>
                        <li>People have been trained to an appropriate level.</li>
                        <li>There are no blockers to using agile from peripheral areas such as procurement or quality
                            assurance (i.e. they understand the philosophy too).</li>
                    </ul>
